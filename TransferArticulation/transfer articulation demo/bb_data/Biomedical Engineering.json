We will use critical analysis and philosophical argument to scrutinize beliefs about morality, free will and determinism, the problem of evil, social justice, and knowledge and skepticism. These analytic skills are transferable to other disciplines and life in general.",

Students will read/view, critically analyze and apply a variety of multimodal sources (e.g., films, documentaries, video clips, scholarly work, magazine articles, charts, and reputable institutional websites). The course will foreground issues of power and privilege and the ways in which socially constructed factors, such as race, ethnicity, class (socio-economic status), sexual identities, and other socially constructed factors, interact with educational (mis)opportunities and (under)achievement. The course also provides opportunities for students to analyze, their own educational experiences- from a critical perspective. Course goals include: 1) to develop students' critical and quantitative literacy skills (through the integration of quantitative charts that relate to the course topics), and 2) to make connections between various historical events and present-day educational issues and concerns.",

We will focus on Islam as a culture by asking how it spread and changed, how it produced traditions and institutions, and how it has both shaped and adapted to the realities of the modern world. The course will ask students to consider the religion and civilizations of the Islamic world as dynamic processes by looking for patterns of structure formation, institutionalization, change and decline in the political, economic, military and cultural realms. While the main focus will be on the Middle East heartland of classical Islam, the spread of Islam to Africa, South and Southeast Asia and the west will also be examined. Students will be expected to illustrate mastery of basic geographical, historical and doctrinal information, as well as to show increasing ability to critically evaluate certain central questions with regard to a variety of historical and geographical contexts and to mobilize evidence in defense of their views.",

What are the major challenges facing Mexico today? Why do so many people migrate away from Mexico-and why do even more Mexicans return home?  What historical and contemporary forces have shaped contemporary Mexico? We will learn about major topics including immigration, racial and ethnic diversity, democracy and political change, inequality, environmental change, violence, injustice and impunity, and Mexico in the global context (especially Mexico-United States relations). In the process, you will gain a far better understanding than most North Americans have of the peoples, environments, cultures and regions of Mexico, and of the complex political, economic and social structures that influence the region and its international relations, especially with the United States. This course focuses on current challenges of development, environment, and politics in Mexico. It will examine how Mexico has dealt with such issues as economic development and human rights. We will also explore environmental and indigenous politics, resource struggles, urban challenges, and the impact of the war on drugs. The last part of the class examines Mexican migration experiences, U.S. immigration policy, and the social and environmental context of the U.S.-Mexico border. \n\nStudents are encouraged to follow the news about Mexico to keep up with rapidly-changing events and ideas. Some of the topics we cover are controversial (e.g., revolutions, immigration, drugs and U.S. intervention) and you may not always agree with the opinions expressed by the readings, professors, teaching assistants, or your fellow students.  We encourage you to express your ideas and to question the ideas presented to you, in a constructive manner that shows respect for the views of others.",

Students who complete the course will understand the role media plays in a society and be able to navigate the complex world of fake news, filter bubbles and talking heads, creating engaged and educated consumers of information.",

After studying classical and scholarly approaches to studying the idea of the Mediterranean, interactive and ecologizing, in the longue durée and microhistories, we shall explore the culture and history of Mediterranean cities and their societies.  Our exploration traces ethnic and religious diversity, cultural, economic, political exchange and the history and representation of built environments. We consider the ways in which the city has been imagined in French, Italian and English literature. As the course unfolds, students engage with cultural ideas that have long captured the imagination of writers worldwide. We study the city as a dreamscape \"cité pleine de ręves,\" and move on to trace literary conceptions of travel, the Grand Tour and the seduction of the Mediterranean city and the northern tourist.  Following our close study of Venice mentalities, our course traces the history of networks and connectivity within medieval and early modern Mediterranean milieus. Aside from the familiar city-states and ports of call, we study in depth the free port city of Livorno and Jewish Sephardi diaspora.  Units follow on colonialism and post-colonialism in the North African Mediterranean city intertwined with cinematic narratives of the region.  Final units of the course trace the aesthetic, architectural, photographic representations of Mediterranean urban modernism from Mussoliniżs imprimatur on the landscape of Rome to the extraordinary developments of twentieth century art, architecture and urban design in Marseilles. To engage with contemporary issues, in the final unit we study representations of the cultural impact of migration on the region reading from Algerian born Italian author Amara Lakhous.  It is hoped that by the end of the course, students will have developed a foundational grasp of the Mediterranean city from the French and Italian perspectives and learned to distinguish among intertwining ideas of regional and national politics, economies, colonial and post-colonial imaginaries and myths and popular culture.",

We explore how different stakeholders have used the concept of nature in debates ranging from climate change and genetically-modified foods to the importance of race in athletic performance. Moreover, students will engage in hands-on and out-of-the-classroom activities introducing them to methods of data-gathering and analysis used in cultural anthropology and the earth sciences.",

Second, we will examine more\n\"modern\" forms of propaganda, as it appears in political advertising,\nspeeches, and newspapers in the United States and other western\ndemocracies. Third, we will study the use of logical political\narguments, and how these differ from propagandistic arguments.

After studying classical and scholarly approaches to studying the idea of the Mediterranean, interactive and ecologizing, in the longue durée and microhistories, we shall explore the culture and history of Mediterranean cities and their societies.  Our exploration traces ethnic and religious diversity, cultural, economic, political exchange and the history and representation of built environments. We consider the ways in which the city has been imagined in French, Italian and English literature. As the course unfolds, students engage with cultural ideas that have long captured the imagination of writers worldwide. We study the city as a dreamscape \"cité pleine de ręves,\" and move on to trace literary conceptions of travel, the Grand Tour and the seduction of the Mediterranean city and the northern tourist.  Following our close study of Venice mentalities, our course traces the history of networks and connectivity within medieval and early modern Mediterranean milieus. Aside from the familiar city-states and ports of call, we study in depth the free port city of Livorno and Jewish Sephardi diaspora.  Units follow on colonialism and post-colonialism in the North African Mediterranean city intertwined with cinematic narratives of the region.  Final units of the course trace the aesthetic, architectural, photographic representations of Mediterranean urban modernism from Mussoliniżs imprimatur on the landscape of Rome to the extraordinary developments of twentieth century art, architecture and urban design in Marseilles. To engage with contemporary issues, in the final unit we study representations of the cultural impact of migration on the region reading from Algerian born Italian author Amara Lakhous.  It is hoped that by the end of the course, students will have developed a foundational grasp of the Mediterranean city from the French and Italian perspectives and learned to distinguish among intertwining ideas of regional and national politics, economies, colonial and post-colonial imaginaries and myths and popular culture.",

The course will focus on four broad topics: Understanding finance's role in economic development and opportunity, how speculative bubbles arise and affect society, the \"sleazy side\" (Shiller's words) of finance (including scams and potential exploitation of the poor), and topics related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing (including theoretical arguments, impact investing, divestment, microfinance, and corporate activism). (Note - the course will have very little focus on mathematical concepts beyond understand understanding the basics of risk, expected return, and realized return).",

In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh was simultaneously a religious, political, economic, and legal institution. This course illuminates and critically examines the duties of the pharaoh and the lives of the individual men and women who occupied this exclusive class, which was perhaps the most powerful monarchy in human history. Frequently seen in the popular imagination as the superlative example of the \"Oriental despot\" stereotype (and often inviting comparisons with modern political figures), the Egyptian kingship was rather laden with responsibility. As a divine son (or, occasionally, daughter), a king was, hypothetically, priest of all the gods. Most important of these royal duties was the perpetuation of order on social and cosmic levels. The wealth of the country flowed both to and from the pharaoh, who was also, in the ideal, responsible for the importation of foreign goods as either tribute or booty. How kings achieved all of this \"and what exactly was expected of him or her\"; varied through three thousand years of pharaonic history. Within Egypt, society changed. Beyond Egypt, the political and economic fortunes of its neighbors changed. The course will cover kingship in Egypt from its ill-understood beginnings among prehistoric tribal chiefdoms, through the surprisingly early climax of royal power manifested by the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza, to the development of mummification as a form to preserve the king's body for eternity, into its travails and final usurpation by Greek rulers.",

This course will explore these writings and what they have to tell us about understanding human experience and our interface with the natural world. Using applied humanities approaches and a variety of texts, our goal will be to develop real-world applications of insight, perspective, critical understanding, discernment, and creativity about the place and importance of nature in human experience. Over the course of the semester we will: (1) read and critically analyze writing by and about people who have found creative and innovative approaches to express and/or measure how immersion in nature makes humans healthier; (2) engage in reflective projects that open pathways to developing oneżs own creativity and imagination for personal and community applications of nature immersion; and (3) design an applied project focused on assessing how ideas for nature immersion might be implemented in real-world settings. Students will use project management and planning methods to write a project description, carry out an initial pilot version of the project, report on steps they have accomplished, and write a critical analysis of their project.",

Why are such unusual beliefs part of the human experience for so many? Why do some people find such phenomena to be compelling, while others reject them outright? How do we decide which claims are credible? What distinguishes rational from irrational claims? This course is designed to help students answer such questions, to understand why people believe weird stuff, and through that process become more empathetic and independent thinkers and learners.",

Over the course of the semester we will: 1) survey the history of video games and their industry, paying particular attention to how developers - and the technologies they deploy - shape the game medium; 2) unpack game sights, sounds, and stories, with an analytical eye toward their formal and ideological qualities; and 3) collaboratively examine video games as sites of cultural exchange, that is, as teaching and learning tools, playful companions, and complex social and physical stimuli.",

We use language not only to communicate with each other, we use to in our dreams, in our art, and some have even argued that language is the stuff of thought itself. This course introduces concepts and methods in linguistics - the scientific study of language - along with important concepts and tools from psychology, anthropology, biology, computation, and philosophy. Students learn to understand their own everyday language behavior and that of others as regular, creative, productive and rule-governed. Students develop understanding and appreciation of the complexity, intricacy and beauty of human language by learning about real languages - including spoken and signed languages, thriving and endangered languages, local and remote languages -and consider whether non-human animal communication systems might, or might not, be thought of as 'languages'. Students learn about language in the brain, and the complex interplay of 'nature' and 'nurture' in language acquisition and development, understand the normal and healthy roles that multilingualism play in human development and in society, recognize the rich and diverse linguistic heritage of Arizona, the US and the world, analyze their own innovative language use and linguistic repertoires, and practice applying the tools of the linguist to the languages they see and hear every day, as well as those they've never before experienced.",

Do gender and biological sex always \"match\". How is gender socially constructed? How do other social categories, such as race, class, and sexuality, influence sex and gender? Then we explore the relationships between gender and social institutions including work, education, the media, the family, and the legal and political systems. Throughout the course, we focus on understanding how people experience gender in everyday life.",

The course will examine the important economic variables that, on the one hand, have led to a rapidly growing worldwide consumer demand for goods and services and, on the other hand, have resulted in increased debt, overspending and an inability to achieve long term personal financial goals. An objective analysis of both personal and global consumption habits will provide the transition into sustainable strategies to increase personal financial solvency. The course will not provide you with the answers to achieving your personal financial goals, but rather will examine our consumer society and expose you to the major reasons why people spend and save. The aim of the course is to provide you with sufficient information to make judgments for yourself about your consumption patterns and long-term financial health.",

It was a divisive issue when the Constitution was drafted in 1787; it was the central issue in a series of compromises that ultimately failed to hold the nation together in 1860; it was the most visible issue in both the Civil War and the worst riots in the nation's history that followed in the present century. In his Second Inaugural speech on January 20, 1997, President Bill Clinton correctly described racism as America's \"constant curse.\" The purpose of this course is to identify and explain why this is so.",

The course has two distinct foci: understanding different leadership styles and preparing to conduct original research to address social and economic inequalities.\n\t\n\tThe focus on leadership will be based on understanding different and contrasting styles of leadership. Students will examine different theories including concepts linked to authoritarian, totalitarian, democratic and social justice styles of leadership. Students will critically analyze examples of leaders with varying styles within the local community, across the nation, and around the world.  Social justice leadership will be introduced to determine the degree to which contemporary leaders respond to the needs and interests of the community, whether that community exists at the local, national, and global level. The theoretical framework for social justice leadership derives from Antonio Gramsci's concept of \"organic intellectualism,\" (See The Prison Notebook) which argues that ANY and ALL individuals (regardless of social and economic status) can develop their intellectual/critical capacities to produce change within their own communities.  The literature on organic intellectualism will be reviewed and incorporated into students' analysis.\n\t\n\tStudents will develop a plan for undertaking original research that addresses social or economic inequalities in either the local, national, or global context.  In doing so, students will develop informed opinions about social and economic inequalities that exist locally and across the world. Students will learn different and competing theoretical and ideological interpretations of inequality as they are depicted in scholarship, popular discourse, and in the media. Social justice research will be introduced as intellectual and analytical means to improve the quality of life of those who are less fortunate. The methodological approach to social justice research is \"participatory action research,\" (See Borda and Rahman's Action and Knowledge: breaking the monopoly with participatory action research) in which individuals work collectively to study and address social and economic problems within their communities. Students will complete proposals for participatory action research projects and present them at a community forum.  Although the research proposal will be local, students will learn how these skills and practices can be applied to social justice issues around the world.",

We will explore the different roles that these mind-altering substances played within various religious and medical traditions and investigate the role of Cannabis, psychedelics and alcohol within the economic, social and political realms of antiquity. In order to do this, we will read portions of primary texts in translation and learn to interpret visual and material culture. The primary focus will be to understand how these psychotropic substances were employed within all aspects of society. By understanding the various uses of psychotropic substances in a comparative context, students may better understand how to think critically about the role of drugs beyond their recreational use, thereby fostering an understanding of different cultures and their uses of psychotropics.",

We will examine the social impact of these technologies, especially how they disrupted established social relations, unsettling customary ways of dividing the private person and family from the more public setting of the community. At the same time, we will focus on the persistent cultural beliefs that have been linked with communications technologies.  Throughout the semester we will be comparing and contrasting our contemporary experience of ubiquitous communication and computing with how electronic presence has been experienced and imagined in the past.",

The course is divided into units, each of which takes up a different social-scientific lens through which to explore the topic: archaeology, history, political science, anthropology and geography are among those disciplines likely to be represented. A lecture from a UA professor is typically matched with an exemplary talk from a member of the community in order to provide not just an interdisciplinary view, but also analytical perspectives that are not necessarily purely academic. Students will be assigned reading for each unit, and will engage in active field work as well as critical writing in response to materials presented. Regular discussions with the course coordinators and instructor provide opportunities to make connections among the different learning experiences in the class.",

Explore new ideas about sports and related activities as they intersect with popular culture and science.  Core topics include race, gender, sexuality, and national identity projects, and basic landmarks in the history of sport in the US.  Secondary topics will vary but may include eating disorders/obesity, college sports finance and participation, injuries and risk, fitness crazes, sports participation and economic inequality, ability/disability, health disparities and physical activity, and related topics.",

Throughout the semester we will focus on cultural criminological concepts and the making and marking of contemporary urban space. By looking at the locations and context in which community members and law enforcement interact, you will get a better understanding of the role space + place play in criminality and criminalization. This course will also provide you with a geographical lens through which to study contemporary and contentious social interactions as well as provide you with critical thinking skills, insight, and terminology needed to evaluate complex social phenomena concerning clashes over race, place, class, gender, and ultimately the right to the city.\n\nThe texts for this course also provide contemporary and up close ethnographic views of neighborhoods where human agents struggle over identity and community. This course relies on perspectives from the fields of cultural geography and critical criminology in addition to critical studies of race and contemporary US urban society. \n\nAdditional course concepts and topics include: cultural criminality, black and white spatial imaginaries, the under-policing/over-policing paradox, cities within the city, Chicano and Latino urbanism, gang injunctions and gentrification, transgression and contestation, community policing, civil gang injunctions, \"all city\" graffiti, broken windows theory, moral geographies, and the deeply superficial aspects of capital, style, and expression.\n \nYou will emerge from this course better able to identify, discuss, and defend your own informed position on the nuances and realities of contemporary crime, criminality, and criminalization. You will also come away with a better understanding of the composition of the city, its historical development and ideological structures, as well as a critical perspective of the formation of transgressive subcultures and processes of community and neighborhood change. You will also develop the language needed to critically read, interpret and understand scholarly texts, as well as become up to date on contemporary debates and thinking about criminality and the policing of urban space. This is a course designed for students of all interests, perspectives, backgrounds, experiences, majors, training, and years of study. The only preparation you need for this class is a willingness to stay engaged.",

The biological perspective explores the evolutionary history and adaptive dimensions of human fatherhood, including comparisons with forms of parenting and family life in other primate species, male life history strategies, and the contributions of genetic, developmental, physiological and ecological factors to fatherhood. The cultural perspective examines the ways in which fatherhood, marriage, and families vary across cultures, in relation to differences in social traditions and practices, socio-political systems, and modes of subsistence. The synthesis of these two perspectives consists of understanding socio-cultural variability in human paternal behavior in the context of human evolutionary adaptations to past and ongoing social and ecological pressures. Through in-class group activities and homework assignments students will apply current theories and data concerning fatherhood to their own lives, and will pursue their implications for society at large.",

Students will read/view, critically analyze and apply a variety of multimodal sources (e.g., films, documentaries, video clips, scholarly work, magazine articles, charts, and reputable institutional websites). The course will foreground issues of power and privilege and the ways in which socially constructed factors, such as race, ethnicity, class (socio-economic status), sexual identities, and other socially constructed factors, interact with educational (mis)opportunities and (under)achievement. The course also provides opportunities for students to analyze, their own educational experiences- from a critical perspective. Course goals include: 1) to develop students' critical and quantitative literacy skills (through the integration of quantitative charts that relate to the course topics), and 2) to make connections between various historical events and present-day educational issues and concerns.",

We will focus on Islam as a culture by asking how it spread and changed, how it produced traditions and institutions, and how it has both shaped and adapted to the realities of the modern world. The course will ask students to consider the religion and civilizations of the Islamic world as dynamic processes by looking for patterns of structure formation, institutionalization, change and decline in the political, economic, military and cultural realms. While the main focus will be on the Middle East heartland of classical Islam, the spread of Islam to Africa, South and Southeast Asia and the west will also be examined. Students will be expected to illustrate mastery of basic geographical, historical and doctrinal information, as well as to show increasing ability to critically evaluate certain central questions with regard to a variety of historical and geographical contexts and to mobilize evidence in defense of their views.",

What are the major challenges facing Mexico today? Why do so many people migrate away from Mexico-and why do even more Mexicans return home?  What historical and contemporary forces have shaped contemporary Mexico? We will learn about major topics including immigration, racial and ethnic diversity, democracy and political change, inequality, environmental change, violence, injustice and impunity, and Mexico in the global context (especially Mexico-United States relations). In the process, you will gain a far better understanding than most North Americans have of the peoples, environments, cultures and regions of Mexico, and of the complex political, economic and social structures that influence the region and its international relations, especially with the United States. This course focuses on current challenges of development, environment, and politics in Mexico. It will examine how Mexico has dealt with such issues as economic development and human rights. We will also explore environmental and indigenous politics, resource struggles, urban challenges, and the impact of the war on drugs. The last part of the class examines Mexican migration experiences, U.S. immigration policy, and the social and environmental context of the U.S.-Mexico border. \n\nStudents are encouraged to follow the news about Mexico to keep up with rapidly-changing events and ideas. Some of the topics we cover are controversial (e.g., revolutions, immigration, drugs and U.S. intervention) and you may not always agree with the opinions expressed by the readings, professors, teaching assistants, or your fellow students.  We encourage you to express your ideas and to question the ideas presented to you, in a constructive manner that shows respect for the views of others.",

This course will explore how the news media as an influential institution shapes political, social and cultural conversations in society and acts as a check on government power. The course will give you a behind-the-scenes look at how journalists do their job, the sometimes deadly clash between individual expression and government control, your rights under the First Amendment, and why campus preachers can say hateful things but you can't shout fire in a crowded theater. We'll also look at copyright, libel, the current economic crisis related to advertising. Students who complete the course will understand the role media plays in a society and be able to navigate the complex world of fake news, filter bubbles and talking heads, creating engaged and educated consumers of information.",

After studying classical and scholarly approaches to studying the idea of the Mediterranean, interactive and ecologizing, in the longue durée and microhistories, we shall explore the culture and history of Mediterranean cities and their societies.  Our exploration traces ethnic and religious diversity, cultural, economic, political exchange and the history and representation of built environments. We consider the ways in which the city has been imagined in French, Italian and English literature. As the course unfolds, students engage with cultural ideas that have long captured the imagination of writers worldwide. We study the city as a dreamscape \"cité pleine de ręves,\" and move on to trace literary conceptions of travel, the Grand Tour and the seduction of the Mediterranean city and the northern tourist.  Following our close study of Venice mentalities, our course traces the history of networks and connectivity within medieval and early modern Mediterranean milieus. Aside from the familiar city-states and ports of call, we study in depth the free port city of Livorno and Jewish Sephardi diaspora.  Units follow on colonialism and post-colonialism in the North African Mediterranean city intertwined with cinematic narratives of the region.  Final units of the course trace the aesthetic, architectural, photographic representations of Mediterranean urban modernism from Mussoliniżs imprimatur on the landscape of Rome to the extraordinary developments of twentieth century art, architecture and urban design in Marseilles. To engage with contemporary issues, in the final unit we study representations of the cultural impact of migration on the region reading from Algerian born Italian author Amara Lakhous.  It is hoped that by the end of the course, students will have developed a foundational grasp of the Mediterranean city from the French and Italian perspectives and learned to distinguish among intertwining ideas of regional and national politics, economies, colonial and post-colonial imaginaries and myths and popular culture.",

The course will show students how to recognize\npolitical propaganda, and how to distinguish propaganda from reasoned,\nlogical political arguments. The course will have four components:\nFirst, it will examine the role of propaganda in totalitarian regimes,\nsuch as Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. Second, we will examine more\n\"modern\" forms of propaganda, as it appears in political advertising,\nspeeches, and newspapers in the United States and other western\ndemocracies. Third, we will study the use of logical political\narguments, and how these differ from propagandistic arguments. Fourth,\nthis course aims to improve basic skills, especially the incorporation\nof logical thought and analysis into the writing of student papers.",

After studying classical and scholarly approaches to studying the idea of the Mediterranean, interactive and ecologizing, in the longue durée and microhistories, we shall explore the culture and history of Mediterranean cities and their societies.  Our exploration traces ethnic and religious diversity, cultural, economic, political exchange and the history and representation of built environments. We consider the ways in which the city has been imagined in French, Italian and English literature. As the course unfolds, students engage with cultural ideas that have long captured the imagination of writers worldwide. We study the city as a dreamscape \"cité pleine de ręves,\" and move on to trace literary conceptions of travel, the Grand Tour and the seduction of the Mediterranean city and the northern tourist.  Following our close study of Venice mentalities, our course traces the history of networks and connectivity within medieval and early modern Mediterranean milieus. Aside from the familiar city-states and ports of call, we study in depth the free port city of Livorno and Jewish Sephardi diaspora.  Units follow on colonialism and post-colonialism in the North African Mediterranean city intertwined with cinematic narratives of the region.  Final units of the course trace the aesthetic, architectural, photographic representations of Mediterranean urban modernism from Mussoliniżs imprimatur on the landscape of Rome to the extraordinary developments of twentieth century art, architecture and urban design in Marseilles. To engage with contemporary issues, in the final unit we study representations of the cultural impact of migration on the region reading from Algerian born Italian author Amara Lakhous.  It is hoped that by the end of the course, students will have developed a foundational grasp of the Mediterranean city from the French and Italian perspectives and learned to distinguish among intertwining ideas of regional and national politics, economies, colonial and post-colonial imaginaries and myths and popular culture.",

The course will focus on four broad topics: Understanding finance's role in economic development and opportunity, how speculative bubbles arise and affect society, the \"sleazy side\" (Shiller's words) of finance (including scams and potential exploitation of the poor), and topics related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing (including theoretical arguments, impact investing, divestment, microfinance, and corporate activism). (Note - the course will have very little focus on mathematical concepts beyond understand understanding the basics of risk, expected return, and realized return).",

                                "description": "Pyramids and Mummies focuses on the person and role of the king in ancient Egypt, exploring questions about individuals and their role(s) within and shaping their society. In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh was simultaneously a religious, political, economic, and legal institution. This course illuminates and critically examines the duties of the pharaoh and the lives of the individual men and women who occupied this exclusive class, which was perhaps the most powerful monarchy in human history. Frequently seen in the popular imagination as the superlative example of the \"Oriental despot\" stereotype (and often inviting comparisons with modern political figures), the Egyptian kingship was rather laden with responsibility. As a divine son (or, occasionally, daughter), a king was, hypothetically, priest of all the gods. Most important of these royal duties was the perpetuation of order on social and cosmic levels. The wealth of the country flowed both to and from the pharaoh, who was also, in the ideal, responsible for the importation of foreign goods as either tribute or booty. How kings achieved all of this \"and what exactly was expected of him or her\"; varied through three thousand years of pharaonic history. Within Egypt, society changed. Beyond Egypt, the political and economic fortunes of its neighbors changed. The course will cover kingship in Egypt from its ill-understood beginnings among prehistoric tribal chiefdoms, through the surprisingly early climax of royal power manifested by the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza, to the development of mummification as a form to preserve the king's body for eternity, into its travails and final usurpation by Greek rulers.",

Indeed, can we know anything at all? What is the relationship between the mental aspects of our lives and our physical, bodily aspect? Could I still be me if I lost all my memories and all my character traits? What is free will? Does anyone ever have free will? This class will not teach you the \"right\" answers to these questions. But it will teach you the different answers that can be given, and how best to go about arguing for them.",

This course will explore these writings and what they have to tell us about understanding human experience and our interface with the natural world. Using applied humanities approaches and a variety of texts, our goal will be to develop real-world applications of insight, perspective, critical understanding, discernment, and creativity about the place and importance of nature in human experience. Over the course of the semester we will: (1) read and critically analyze writing by and about people who have found creative and innovative approaches to express and/or measure how immersion in nature makes humans healthier; (2) engage in reflective projects that open pathways to developing oneżs own creativity and imagination for personal and community applications of nature immersion; and (3) design an applied project focused on assessing how ideas for nature immersion might be implemented in real-world settings. Students will use project management and planning methods to write a project description, carry out an initial pilot version of the project, report on steps they have accomplished, and write a critical analysis of their project.",

Why are such unusual beliefs part of the human experience for so many? Why do some people find such phenomena to be compelling, while others reject them outright? How do we decide which claims are credible? What distinguishes rational from irrational claims? This course is designed to help students answer such questions, to understand why people believe weird stuff, and through that process become more empathetic and independent thinkers and learners.",

                                "description": "All human communities have language - and our language is central to our lives. We use language not only to communicate with each other, we use to in our dreams, in our art, and some have even argued that language is the stuff of thought itself. This course introduces concepts and methods in linguistics - the scientific study of language - along with important concepts and tools from psychology, anthropology, biology, computation, and philosophy. Students learn to understand their own everyday language behavior and that of others as regular, creative, productive and rule-governed. Students develop understanding and appreciation of the complexity, intricacy and beauty of human language by learning about real languages - including spoken and signed languages, thriving and endangered languages, local and remote languages -and consider whether non-human animal communication systems might, or might not, be thought of as 'languages'. Students learn about language in the brain, and the complex interplay of 'nature' and 'nurture' in language acquisition and development, understand the normal and healthy roles that multilingualism play in human development and in society, recognize the rich and diverse linguistic heritage of Arizona, the US and the world, analyze their own innovative language use and linguistic repertoires, and practice applying the tools of the linguist to the languages they see and hear every day, as well as those they've never before experienced.",

Then we explore the relationships between gender and social institutions including work, education, the media, the family, and the legal and political systems.

The course will examine the important economic variables that, on the one hand, have led to a rapidly growing worldwide consumer demand for goods and services and, on the other hand, have resulted in increased debt, overspending and an inability to achieve long term personal financial goals. An objective analysis of both personal and global consumption habits will provide the transition into sustainable strategies to increase personal financial solvency. The course will not provide you with the answers to achieving your personal financial goals, but rather will examine our consumer society and expose you to the major reasons why people spend and save. The aim of the course is to provide you with sufficient information to make judgments for yourself about your consumption patterns and long-term financial health.",

It was a divisive issue when the Constitution was drafted in 1787; it was the central issue in a series of compromises that ultimately failed to hold the nation together in 1860; it was the most visible issue in both the Civil War and the worst riots in the nation's history that followed in the present century. In his Second Inaugural speech on January 20, 1997, President Bill Clinton correctly described racism as America's \"constant curse.\" The purpose of this course is to identify and explain why this is so.",

The course has two distinct foci: understanding different leadership styles and preparing to conduct original research to address social and economic inequalities.\n\t\n\tThe focus on leadership will be based on understanding different and contrasting styles of leadership. Students will examine different theories including concepts linked to authoritarian, totalitarian, democratic and social justice styles of leadership. Students will critically analyze examples of leaders with varying styles within the local community, across the nation, and around the world.  Social justice leadership will be introduced to determine the degree to which contemporary leaders respond to the needs and interests of the community, whether that community exists at the local, national, and global level. The theoretical framework for social justice leadership derives from Antonio Gramsci's concept of \"organic intellectualism,\" (See The Prison Notebook) which argues that ANY and ALL individuals (regardless of social and economic status) can develop their intellectual/critical capacities to produce change within their own communities.  The literature on organic intellectualism will be reviewed and incorporated into students' analysis.\n\t\n\tStudents will develop a plan for undertaking original research that addresses social or economic inequalities in either the local, national, or global context.  In doing so, students will develop informed opinions about social and economic inequalities that exist locally and across the world. Students will learn different and competing theoretical and ideological interpretations of inequality as they are depicted in scholarship, popular discourse, and in the media. Social justice research will be introduced as intellectual and analytical means to improve the quality of life of those who are less fortunate. The methodological approach to social justice research is \"participatory action research,\" (See Borda and Rahman's Action and Knowledge: breaking the monopoly with participatory action research) in which individuals work collectively to study and address social and economic problems within their communities. Students will complete proposals for participatory action research projects and present them at a community forum.  Although the research proposal will be local, students will learn how these skills and practices can be applied to social justice issues around the world.",

We will explore the different roles that these mind-altering substances played within various religious and medical traditions and investigate the role of Cannabis, psychedelics and alcohol within the economic, social and political realms of antiquity. In order to do this, we will read portions of primary texts in translation and learn to interpret visual and material culture. The primary focus will be to understand how these psychotropic substances were employed within all aspects of society. By understanding the various uses of psychotropic substances in a comparative context, students may better understand how to think critically about the role of drugs beyond their recreational use, thereby fostering an understanding of different cultures and their uses of psychotropics.",

We will examine the social impact of these technologies, especially how they disrupted established social relations, unsettling customary ways of dividing the private person and family from the more public setting of the community. At the same time, we will focus on the persistent cultural beliefs that have been linked with communications technologies.  Throughout the semester we will be comparing and contrasting our contemporary experience of ubiquitous communication and computing with how electronic presence has been experienced and imagined in the past.",

The course is divided into units, each of which takes up a different social-scientific lens through which to explore the topic: archaeology, history, political science, anthropology and geography are among those disciplines likely to be represented. A lecture from a UA professor is typically matched with an exemplary talk from a member of the community in order to provide not just an interdisciplinary view, but also analytical perspectives that are not necessarily purely academic. Students will be assigned reading for each unit, and will engage in active field work as well as critical writing in response to materials presented. Regular discussions with the course coordinators and instructor provide opportunities to make connections among the different learning experiences in the class.",

Topics include access to and conduct of youth and high school sports; access to and outcomes of participation in collegiate and professional sports, institutions and occupations and achievement in sports. \n\nHow do sports reflect, reinforce, and challenge conventional ideas about health, bodies, sexuality, inequality, and identity?  Explore new ideas about sports and related activities as they intersect with popular culture and science.  Core topics include race, gender, sexuality, and national identity projects, and basic landmarks in the history of sport in the US.  Secondary topics will vary but may include eating disorders/obesity, college sports finance and participation, injuries and risk, fitness crazes, sports participation and economic inequality, ability/disability, health disparities and physical activity, and related topics.",

Throughout the semester we will focus on cultural criminological concepts and the making and marking of contemporary urban space. By looking at the locations and context in which community members and law enforcement interact, you will get a better understanding of the role space + place play in criminality and criminalization. This course will also provide you with a geographical lens through which to study contemporary and contentious social interactions as well as provide you with critical thinking skills, insight, and terminology needed to evaluate complex social phenomena concerning clashes over race, place, class, gender, and ultimately the right to the city.\n\nThe texts for this course also provide contemporary and up close ethnographic views of neighborhoods where human agents struggle over identity and community. This course relies on perspectives from the fields of cultural geography and critical criminology in addition to critical studies of race and contemporary US urban society. \n\nAdditional course concepts and topics include: cultural criminality, black and white spatial imaginaries, the under-policing/over-policing paradox, cities within the city, Chicano and Latino urbanism, gang injunctions and gentrification, transgression and contestation, community policing, civil gang injunctions, \"all city\" graffiti, broken windows theory, moral geographies, and the deeply superficial aspects of capital, style, and expression.\n \nYou will emerge from this course better able to identify, discuss, and defend your own informed position on the nuances and realities of contemporary crime, criminality, and criminalization. You will also come away with a better understanding of the composition of the city, its historical development and ideological structures, as well as a critical perspective of the formation of transgressive subcultures and processes of community and neighborhood change. You will also develop the language needed to critically read, interpret and understand scholarly texts, as well as become up to date on contemporary debates and thinking about criminality and the policing of urban space.

The biological perspective explores the evolutionary history and adaptive dimensions of human fatherhood, including comparisons with forms of parenting and family life in other primate species, male life history strategies, and the contributions of genetic, developmental, physiological and ecological factors to fatherhood. The cultural perspective examines the ways in which fatherhood, marriage, and families vary across cultures, in relation to differences in social traditions and practices, socio-political systems, and modes of subsistence. The synthesis of these two perspectives consists of understanding socio-cultural variability in human paternal behavior in the context of human evolutionary adaptations to past and ongoing social and ecological pressures. Through in-class group activities and homework assignments students will apply current theories and data concerning fatherhood to their own lives, and will pursue their implications for society at large.",

Starting with the ancient Greek philosophers and concluding with philosophers from the 17th century, students will explore perennial issues such as: the existence of God, the nature of reality, the problem of evil, and the basis of knowledge. Readings are culled from the history of philosophy, but lectures and discussions will be informed by contemporary considerations.",

What is valuable in life? What reason, if any, do we have to do the right thing? Attention will be given to clarification of conceptions, rigorous argument, and the evaluation of reasons - all with the aim of helping student think philosophically about difficult moral questions.",

Memes are not an entirely digital phenomenon, however. On the contrary, they have a deep history within the context of human ideas and expression. In this course, we will explore the concept of the meme and the practice of meming, beginning with pre-digital examples and extending up through the most current instances. We will consider a variety of theories behind this kind of microstorytelling, as well as its craft, leading to the creation of meme portfolios and predictions about future forms of human expression.",

Select texts analyzing myth as well as works of fiction and contemporary film and television will round out the course as students work toward analyzing their own cosmology, a chosen mythology, or develop their own unique mythology for the digital age. Particular emphasis will be paid to myths and cosmologies of groups in conflict and an analysis of the clash resulting from competing perspectives.",

Students will learn and practice a set of critical and practical skills designed to help them both understand how play regularly changes the world around them, and how to use play as a tool for personal, professional, and political transformation. Over the course of the semester, we will: 1) survey the origins of play, paying particular attention to how the act of play is used to change or solidify the status quo; 2) examine research-informed case studies to learn and practice techniques for theorizing about how and why play does real work in the world; and 3) experiment with a variety of tools and techniques for using play to alter how individuals, communities, and organizations interact.",

This course will provide both fine arts students and the general student with a comprehensive view of the arts- insights into their meaning, their inter-related qualities, both historically and aesthetically, and the terminological, philosophical, and theoretical framework to speak cogently about them. This course will provide historical and aesthetic information, bridging these two realms. Attendance at important concerts, exhibitions, and presentations, will also be a major part of the course. The course will be limited to 250 students.",

Italian cuisine, as diverse and heterogeneous as it is inside the country from North to South, largely contributed to the building of a strong Italian identity, as testified in recent times by the worldwide success of large-scale marketplaces such as Eataly. This course will investigate food's role in shaping Italian society and its cultural practices by looking at images of food in visual art, literature and film. Our historical review will focus on the many symbolic meanings circulating around the representation of food in the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and the 20th and 21st centuries. Food will be a lens through which we will read the political, social, and economic changes that have affected Italy in its millennial history.",

Focusing on Canada, the United States, and the U.S.-Mexico border region, students will examine the historical and contemporary lived experiences of ethnic communities within North America through analysis of their sounding cultures. Musical case studies provide the pathway to understand culture, develop skill in the critical analysis of musical sound and performance, and identify the interconnections of music with the lives, histories, politics, and beliefs of the people and societies which make and consume it. This will be accomplished through reading, listening, and writing assignments, as well as musical performance workshops, media, and direct engagement with cultural practitioners and scholars.",

                                "description": "This interdisciplinary honors course introduces students to the humanities in a contemporary context and explores the relationship of current 'public' works to those of the past.  Students will examine and explore works produced throughout the history of Western culture, primarily literary works, with an emphasis on the active role humanistic endeavors play in contemporary culture.  Students will read texts in a range of genres, but the key component of the course will be a significant encounter with current and public literature and the arts outside the classroom.  To this end, each time the course is offered, the course materials will be linked to a particular significant public cultural experience; this might be a local theater production, a set of public readings, film(s), or even visual arts or architecture.  The methodology for analyzing these works, however, will be humanistic; this is not a course in the practice of fine arts, but rather a humanistic reading of academic and public culture.",

How has our cuisine evolved? And how do food and consumption reflect status and power? This course investigates these and other questions by considering the discovery, evolution, and migration of food and drink in world history in cultural context from pre-modern times to the present. We explore the discovery, invention, and adaptation of new foods from early human history to our own post-Columbian era, when local foods have become truly global. Food and drink have transformed continents and trading networks, and made and broken empires. Food is a site of cultural exchange and interaction, and it is also an expression and marker of identities. Wars have been fought to control food access. Dining, retail, and industrialization have reshaped the way we look at food. We will trace the origins, migration, and reinvention of global foods to understand how it is that food choice, food waste, and famine are more abundant today than at any point in human history.",

The purpose of this course lay the foundation of architectural literacy. The basis of this knowledge is found in understanding the relationship between a society and the forms it creates. This is accomplished through studying the major components that effect architecture: region, culture, and technology. the course follows these factors through the history of western civilization, from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe and America. Greater emphasis is given to the contemporary period because radical changes in technology and resources make this information more pertinent to the present.",

We will explore the different ways that the religious traditions of South Asia understand supernatural beings and forces. In order to do this we will read portions of primary texts in translation, examine iconography, and watch rituals as they unfold. In addition to learning about the South Asia traditions, we will put those conceptions of the divine in conversation with those rooted in a European context, forcing you to learn to think critically about the ways people from different cultures view the world around them.",

Asia is far too large and diverse to be studied thoroughly in one single semester, and thus this course will serve as an introduction to a number of important themes and topics in the study of East, South, and Southeast Asia. In particular, we will focus on the dynamic movement of people and ideas to investigate multiple sites of interaction within Asia and between Asia and other parts of the world. We will begin with an exploration of the Mughal and Manchu empires in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and conclude with the popularity of Indian Bollywood and Japanese Anime in the twenty-first-century United States. \n\nBecause this is a course that traces both the outlines of Asian history but also, and perhaps more importantly, the interaction of Asian cultures with global trends and patterns as well as the construction of 'Asia' in the rest of the world, the texts we will read are not restricted to archival sources from Asia. You will use first-hand accounts, film, literature, and material artifacts to trace the development and significance of various trans-cultural connections that have shaped histories and identities within Asia and around the world.",

This course is designed to examine Confucianism in Asia through education, and the importance of ritual and propriety. Beginning at the beginning, with the life of Confucius in the 6th century BCE and the principle text that bears his name, the Analects, we will explore the central ideas of Confucianism and their adoption and adaptation by different Asian societies at different times. We will end with a consideration of issues in contemporary Asia and among the Asian-American population in the U.S. that demonstrate the continued importance of this way of thought.",

We will examine the religious symbolism of ancient Chinese bronze vessels, Chinese theories of nature based on concepts like Yin and Yang, the great medieval religions of Taoism and Buddhism, and other topics. Over the semester you will learn to think more like the Chinese of centuries past to exercise your imagination, and to explore a world that is different from your own.",

Discussion of ancient Egypt, from its Mesolithic foundations in the savannahs of North Africa ca. 12,000 BCE through its Pharaonic Period and conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, is arranged in chronological and thematic units, each being placed in context of social, political, religious, and natural environments. For example, the course examines ancient creation myths, the diversity and origins of the gods, concept of the afterlife, religious symbolism of the built environment (temples, pyramids, tombs, etc.), and interconnections between other African, Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures. During the semester students will learn about core concepts that have long impacted Western cultures and will explore a world vastly different from their own. ",

What is valuable in life? What reason, if any, do we have to do the right thing? Attention will be given to clarification of conceptions, rigorous argument, and the evaluation of reasons - all with the aim of helping student think philosophically about difficult moral questions.",

Memes are not an entirely digital phenomenon, however. On the contrary, they have a deep history within the context of human ideas and expression. In this course, we will explore the concept of the meme and the practice of meming, beginning with pre-digital examples and extending up through the most current instances. We will consider a variety of theories behind this kind of microstorytelling, as well as its craft, leading to the creation of meme portfolios and predictions about future forms of human expression.",

Beginning with an overview of myth as a moving force in life, students generate a list of grand mysteries to pursue answers that explore the past, present, and future. Select texts analyzing myth as well as works of fiction and contemporary film and television will round out the course as students work toward analyzing their own cosmology, a chosen mythology, or develop their own unique mythology for the digital age. Particular emphasis will be paid to myths and cosmologies of groups in conflict and an analysis of the clash resulting from competing perspectives.",

Students will learn and practice a set of critical and practical skills designed to help them both understand how play regularly changes the world around them, and how to use play as a tool for personal, professional, and political transformation. Over the course of the semester, we will: 1) survey the origins of play, paying particular attention to how the act of play is used to change or solidify the status quo; 2) examine research-informed case studies to learn and practice techniques for theorizing about how and why play does real work in the world; and 3) experiment with a variety of tools and techniques for using play to alter how individuals, communities, and organizations interact.",

This course will provide historical and aesthetic information, bridging these two realms. Attendance at important concerts, exhibitions, and presentations, will also be a major part of the course. The course will be limited to 250 students.",

Italian cuisine, as diverse and heterogeneous as it is inside the country from North to South, largely contributed to the building of a strong Italian identity, as testified in recent times by the worldwide success of large-scale marketplaces such as Eataly. This course will investigate food's role in shaping Italian society and its cultural practices by looking at images of food in visual art, literature and film. Our historical review will focus on the many symbolic meanings circulating around the representation of food in the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and the 20th and 21st centuries. Food will be a lens through which we will read the political, social, and economic changes that have affected Italy in its millennial history.",

Focusing on Canada, the United States, and the U.S.-Mexico border region, students will examine the historical and contemporary lived experiences of ethnic communities within North America through analysis of their sounding cultures. Musical case studies provide the pathway to understand culture, develop skill in the critical analysis of musical sound and performance, and identify the interconnections of music with the lives, histories, politics, and beliefs of the people and societies which make and consume it. This will be accomplished through reading, listening, and writing assignments, as well as musical performance workshops, media, and direct engagement with cultural practitioners and scholars.",

Students will examine and explore works produced throughout the history of Western culture, primarily literary works, with an emphasis on the active role humanistic endeavors play in contemporary culture.  Students will read texts in a range of genres, but the key component of the course will be a significant encounter with current and public literature and the arts outside the classroom.  To this end, each time the course is offered, the course materials will be linked to a particular significant public cultural experience; this might be a local theater production, a set of public readings, film(s), or even visual arts or architecture.  The methodology for analyzing these works, however, will be humanistic; this is not a course in the practice of fine arts, but rather a humanistic reading of academic and public culture.",

How has our cuisine evolved? And how do food and consumption reflect status and power? This course investigates these and other questions by considering the discovery, evolution, and migration of food and drink in world history in cultural context from pre-modern times to the present. We explore the discovery, invention, and adaptation of new foods from early human history to our own post-Columbian era, when local foods have become truly global. Food and drink have transformed continents and trading networks, and made and broken empires. Food is a site of cultural exchange and interaction, and it is also an expression and marker of identities. Wars have been fought to control food access. Dining, retail, and industrialization have reshaped the way we look at food. We will trace the origins, migration, and reinvention of global foods to understand how it is that food choice, food waste, and famine are more abundant today than at any point in human history.",

The purpose of this course lay the foundation of architectural literacy. The basis of this knowledge is found in understanding the relationship between a society and the forms it creates. This is accomplished through studying the major components that effect architecture: region, culture, and technology. the course follows these factors through the history of western civilization, from ancient Greece to contemporary Europe and America. Greater emphasis is given to the contemporary period because radical changes in technology and resources make this information more pertinent to the present.",

We will explore the different ways that the religious traditions of South Asia understand supernatural beings and forces. In order to do this we will read portions of primary texts in translation, examine iconography, and watch rituals as they unfold. In addition to learning about the South Asia traditions, we will put those conceptions of the divine in conversation with those rooted in a European context, forcing you to learn to think critically about the ways people from different cultures view the world around them.",

Asia is far too large and diverse to be studied thoroughly in one single semester, and thus this course will serve as an introduction to a number of important themes and topics in the study of East, South, and Southeast Asia. In particular, we will focus on the dynamic movement of people and ideas to investigate multiple sites of interaction within Asia and between Asia and other parts of the world. We will begin with an exploration of the Mughal and Manchu empires in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and conclude with the popularity of Indian Bollywood and Japanese Anime in the twenty-first-century United States. \n\nBecause this is a course that traces both the outlines of Asian history but also, and perhaps more importantly, the interaction of Asian cultures with global trends and patterns as well as the construction of 'Asia' in the rest of the world, the texts we will read are not restricted to archival sources from Asia. You will use first-hand accounts, film, literature, and material artifacts to trace the development and significance of various trans-cultural connections that have shaped histories and identities within Asia and around the world.",

This course is designed to examine Confucianism in Asia through education, and the importance of ritual and propriety. Beginning at the beginning, with the life of Confucius in the 6th century BCE and the principle text that bears his name, the Analects, we will explore the central ideas of Confucianism and their adoption and adaptation by different Asian societies at different times. We will end with a consideration of issues in contemporary Asia and among the Asian-American population in the U.S. that demonstrate the continued importance of this way of thought.",

We will examine the religious symbolism of ancient Chinese bronze vessels, Chinese theories of nature based on concepts like Yin and Yang, the great medieval religions of Taoism and Buddhism, and other topics. Over the semester you will learn to think more like the Chinese of centuries past to exercise your imagination, and to explore a world that is different from your own.",

Discussion of ancient Egypt, from its Mesolithic foundations in the savannahs of North Africa ca. 12,000 BCE through its Pharaonic Period and conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, is arranged in chronological and thematic units, each being placed in context of social, political, religious, and natural environments. For example, the course examines ancient creation myths, the diversity and origins of the gods, concept of the afterlife, religious symbolism of the built environment (temples, pyramids, tombs, etc.), and interconnections between other African, Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures. During the semester students will learn about core concepts that have long impacted Western cultures and will explore a world vastly different from their own. ",

Their experiences tell us something about the complex intersection of sex, gender, and religion in Latin America. This course takes an anthropological approach to consider two central questions: (1) What role do religious ideologies and institutions play in the social construction of sexuality and gender in Latin America? (2) How do Latin Americans enact and contest gender power relations through their religious practices, thus contributing to processes of social change in the region? To address these questions, this class focuses on gender and its relationship to sexual desires and transgressions across diverse religious traditions from the pre-Columbian period to the present.",

The course provides an introductory survey to questions that have been central to the western philosophical tradition: What is religion? Can reasoning or experience give good grounds for religious belief? Does faith require philosophically sound reasoning?  Is it philosophically justified to believe in miracles?  What tools does philosophy provide for examining the concept of \"God\"? How can a good God exist if there's so much suffering in the world? How should humans react to suffering? Is there a conflict between religion and science? How can the diversity of religions be explained? Is religion a good thing for humanity?",

How are understandings and experiences of citizenship bound up with the definition and institutionalization of race/ethnicity, class, and gender? This broad question will be examined in specific areas in Brazil such as public health, urban and rural development, environment, education, law, politics, and pop culture. The course covers theoretical readings and case studies from different geographical areas. Instructional materials are interdisciplinary, drawing mainly on the fields of History, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, and Geography.",

Since independence, the United States has been a major player in the political and economic development of the Latin American region. Conversely, policies and events originating in Latin America shape politics and society in the United States. Course topics include U.S. foreign policy and policy impact on the Latin American region, Latin America's influence on hemispheric relations, and Latin America's diverse policy approaches to the United States and the world. \n\nThe course is organized to first provide students with a historical overview as a foundation for understanding contemporary U.S.-Latin American relations. The focus of the course then shifts to exploring the most critical contemporary policy issues. The course is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the history of U.S.-Latin American relations from Latin America's independence in the early 19th century, through the War on Terror that began in 2001. Part II focuses on five critical policy concerns that shape U.S.-Latin American relations in the 21st century: democracy, economic development, security, the environment, and migration. Students will engage in intense study of one of these policy issues to write an independent research paper, and work in groups to design and present a policy brief at the end of the term.",

After introducing the traditional philosophical problem of the relationship between the mind and the body, and examining the way different approaches to the problem have developed in tandem with different paradigms of scientific psychology, it focuses on three outstanding challenges for the conduct of a science of the mind: emotions, intentionality, and consciousness. With each of these topics, the handful of leading theories developed over the past generation or two of research will be surveyed.",

The course provides an introductory survey to questions that have been central to the western philosophical tradition: What is religion? Can reasoning or experience give good grounds for religious belief? Does faith require philosophically sound reasoning?  Is it philosophically justified to believe in miracles?  What tools does philosophy provide for examining the concept of \"God\"? How can a good God exist if there's so much suffering in the world? How should humans react to suffering? Is there a conflict between religion and science? How can the diversity of religions be explained? Is religion a good thing for humanity?",

Consideration of sport as such induces a host of intriguing and important philosophical questions and topics to which this course serves as an introduction. Sample questions to be explored include: What is competition? What makes for a good game? Is it ever permissible to cheat? Is it wrong to enjoy sports that harm animals? Should doping be banned? Is trash-talking unsportsmanlike? What makes for a good fan? And how should referees enforce rules? Course readings draw from classical philosophical texts, contemporary philosophical discussions of sport, as well as popular sports journalism. Course lectures are interactive, with an emphasis on multimedia presentations of course topics designed to elicit informed critical discussion\namong students.",

The course covers theoretical readings and case studies from different geographical areas. Instructional materials are interdisciplinary, drawing mainly on the fields of History, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, and Geography.",

While the British invented \"football\" (as soccer is known around the world) and professional football, the French were key players in structuring it worldwide. Following in the steps of Pierre de Coubertin who revived the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century, French compatriots Jules Rimet, Robert Guérin, Henri Delaunay, Jacques de Ryswick, Gabriel Hanot, Jacques Goddet, and Jacques Ferran were central figures in the creation of the most important soccer institutions as of today: Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1904, the FIFA World Cup Soccer in 1930, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 1954, the UEFA Coupe d'Europe des Clubs Champions Européens (Champions League) in 1955, and the Ballon d'Or (Golden Ball Award) in 1956. The course provides a strong foundation in the history and development of soccer in France, the Francophone world, and as a worldwide global phenomenon through explorations in the following areas: cultural and global studies, philosophy, history, institutions, the arts, and language. \n\nThe course presents several important themes that will allow us to understand the popularity and identification of the populations with soccer worldwide, as well as the human values it represents: olympism, pacifism, imperialism, colonialism, national identities, race, politics, gender, and globalization.\n\nStudents will read and discuss some of the most important scholarly texts dealing with soccer.",

We will explore evidence from ancient and modern texts, oral histories, art and the archaeological record along with a range of scientific evidence about past environments. We will consider the role of cultural expression in shaping the way societies explain, manage and mitigate for catastrophic change, how the cultural record can be used to inform environmental reconstructions and how climatic and geological 'catastrophe' can seed an artistic and poetic renaissance.",

Their experiences tell us something about the complex intersection of sex, gender, and religion in Latin America. This course takes an anthropological approach to consider two central questions: (1) What role do religious ideologies and institutions play in the social construction of sexuality and gender in Latin America? (2) How do Latin Americans enact and contest gender power relations through their religious practices, thus contributing to processes of social change in the region? To address these questions, this class focuses on gender and its relationship to sexual desires and transgressions across diverse religious traditions from the pre-Columbian period to the present.",

Topics include race and voice (e.g. brown voice); the cybernetic voices of virtual assistants like Siri; the call center; and forensic listening. Everyone has an accent, but some are heard as \"neutral\" and others as markers of difference. This has serious implications: accent discrimination costs jobs, housing applications, and asylum claims. Do literary texts have accents, like people do? Students will gain understanding of the politics of accent and voice, while learning to use their accented voices to produce close, critical readings.",

This means that one's zip code can be more important than their genetic code. Today's complex environmental science problems have far-reaching impacts and require an understanding of natural sciences, health, and justice. This course addresses this challenge by exploring and focusing on how to generate environmental science solutions at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, and community levels. Students will not only gain a fundamental understanding of the natural sciences, health, and justice, they will learn how to apply the science to solve real world problems. Through the lens of environmental justice, this class will emphasize race, socioeconomics, and gender to explore the ways in which diverse individuals and societies are generating solutions to environmental quality and health challenges. The course will focus on the United States but will incorporate case studies from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and/or Middle East.",

Questions we will consider include: Should we eat meat? How will robots, drone bees, and other technologies transform our food system? What does the future of farming and farm labor look like? What are the environmental and social implications of new food products such as lab-grown meats? Will genetically modified organisms (GMOs) help us to feed a global population of 10 billion people? Students will learn from diverse voices and multiple disciplinary perspectives to examine and debate these questions in both written and oral formats.",

                                "description": "This course considers French culture from the worldview of the French Revolutionary period to the present day.   Although this is a survey of French culture, when I use the word \"culture,\" I take it to mean more than just national culture.   After all, culture can and does cut across national boundaries.  Therefore, we will study the culture of France and its people not only from the outlook of the Parisian metropole, but also within local regional and global contexts.  \n\nWe begin by studying the intellectual, political and social processes that culminated in the Revolution of 1789.  You will engage with various interpretations of the Revolution proposed by contemporary scholars.  As the course continues, you will develop a particular understanding of the Revolution in terms of what cultural theorists call symbolic action.  From Napoleon's defeat to the Paris Commune to the dark years of Vichy France and the postwar recovery that followed, this approach will allow us to analyze how certain cultural symbols of the Revolution and their representations have shaped divisions within French political culture over time. When we consider the Revolution in this way, we encounter the theme of French collective memory. We ask certain questions among others such as 1) How has the French past shaped the political differences of the present? 2) How have rival interpretations of a historical event or figure served or undermined the interests of various political communities?  \n\nIn terms of social history, we say that culture is also to be found within the intersection of cultural identities such as gender, race, class and sexuality.  Whether we are studying 19th century representations of the \"unruly\" women of the Paris Commune or the \"dangerous\" subterranean world of the sewers of Paris, or entertainers and artists of the fin de sičcle period, we will analyze both production and reception of cultural values in French society. Throughout the course, you are encouraged to think about French culture from multiple perspectives.  \n\nBy the second half of the course, we will grapple with the complexities of French culture in the age of globalization, considering the problems of colonial legacies and French national \"heritage.\"  We will ask: In what ways has globalization challenged the traditional model of Republicanism, so integral to French political culture?  To answer this question and others, our texts will allow us to analyze French political structures and national identity through the history of French imperialism and regionalism.  We will pay special attention to the failure of the reintegration of former African colonies, in particular, after Algerian independence.  \n\nWhile much of our reading material is based on historical monographs, you will also read works of fiction and analyze films.  In addition, students in this course will have the opportunity to conduct research on a topic of their choice and write a longer paper based on findings.  At the end of this course, it is hoped that all will have a better understanding of the collective construction of the French past as well as come to appreciate the intricate mosaic that constitutes French cultural identity.",

A practice at once familiar and strange, we center surgical interventions to ground abstract concepts of social and political relations firmly in the materiality of the human body. We examine the concepts of belief and belonging through analyzing male circumcision; cultural relativism and its limits through female genital cutting; the constitution of race through cosmetic procedures that reshape the eyes and nose; nationalism and patriotism through the rehabilitation of soldiers' bodies; the constitution of sex and gender through trans- and intersex genital surgeries; the ethical pull of kinship through in-family kidney donation; economic globalization through surgical tourism; and the concept of the individual subject through post-amputation phantom limb pain and the medical imperative to separate conjoined twins. These procedures invite us to consider the body as a site at which particular ideas about what is \"normal\" and what is \"good\" quite literally find their form. They make manifest the economic, racial, political and ethical forces through which contemporary life and value unfold. Building on the foundations of Tier I anthropology courses, this course introduces students to the unique ways that anthropology engages the practices and beliefs at the heart of medicine. This is a Tier II GenEd course.",

This course examines the various ways in which archaeologists investigate and interpret the death rituals of people in the past. Whether it be a pyramid built for a pharaoh or a pit filled with the anonymous skeletons of the poor and destitute, burial can tell us a lot. For the archaeologist, burials provide much information about beliefs and values; social divisions and status; kinship; health and diet; and identity. Drawing on case studies from a broad span of time periods and cultures, we will look at the evidence of tombs and monuments, inscriptions, grave goods, and skeletal remains to reconstruct how ancient societies confronted death.",

These gaps frequently lead to food insecurity with a less healthy populous, as well as food waste, an issue in more developed societies. By examining 1) the food supply chain and markets, 2) food insecurity, 3) food loss and waste along the food supply chain and 4) food policies, students will gain insights into the economic forces that shape the food system. This course stimulates critical thinking and problem solving through economic and policy perspectives, which may lead to potential resolutions for those who struggle to afford and consume healthy, wholesome foods.",

More than only the respective \"rise and fall\" of each empire, we will examine how the rulers of each civilization depicted and justified their policies of conquest, how the pursuit of empire changed the cultures of these civilizations, and how each empire paved the way for the next. In the end, we will be learning how empires in general (mis)function, and how empires are justified to their participants, subjects, and enemies.",

During and in the aftermath of World War II, Jewish survivors resettled across the globe, many of them in Latin America. They were subsequently followed by scores of Nazis attempting to evade prosecution and live in anonymity across the Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, the post-World War II era saw the development of some of the most important concepts and practices of human rights, justice, memory, and reconciliation, ranging from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Nuremberg Trials to the European monuments and human rights memorial museums. In the decades following World War II, when different countries across Latin America were attempting to rebuild in the aftermath of violent dictatorships, civil wars, and decades of internal conflict, they were strongly influenced by these Post-World War II concepts and practices of reckoning with past atrocities and moving toward more peaceful and democratic futures. \n\nThis interdisciplinary cultural studies course will examine the relationship between histories of genocide and mass atrocity and the development of concepts and practices of peace and reconciliation, transitional justice, and memory politics from World War II to the dictatorships and civil wars of the latter half of the 20th century in Latin America.",

It has also become a fiercely debated politic topic in the United States and across the globe. This course will examine theories of migration (who migrates? why do people migrate? where do they go?) and attempt to answer these questions empirically. We will then analyze key debates about the consequences of migration for sending countries and receiving countries alike. We will subsequently examine the varied experiences of migrants, paying particular attention to the United States context. Here, theories of immigrant assimilation as well as economic, sociocultural, and demographic accounts will be assessed. This course will conclude by highlighting immigration policies, international security, and the refugee experience.",

Women make up half the population and have earned more than half of all undergraduate degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s; yet women constitute only 17% of the U.S. Congress, 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs, and 16% of the board of directors of major corporations, 20% of partners in law firms, and 33% of research faculty at universities and 4 year colleges. For women of color, these numbers are considerably lower. Why are there so few women in professional fields like business, law, government, engineering, and medical and scientific research?  Why are there even fewer women in leadership positions in these fields?  In this course we will learn and evaluate many explanations for these disparities, discuss the cost to society for women's underrepresentation in positions of power, and examine how organizations and individuals increase women's leadership and be more inclusive of the diverse people that make up our society.  Because gender inequality goes beyond sheer numbers and because many of the explanations for women's low representation also pertain to other forms of inequality, we will also examine inequality in terms of promotion and pay. Students will engage in an empirical project to investigate gender inequality locally, in Tucson or at the University of Arizona.",

This class explores the implications of what it means to plan for different people in a variety of urban contexts- e.g., transportation safety, homeless women shelters, perceived fear of public space, design of public parks, accessibility of groceries- while addressing the overarching questions: \n.\tWho plans for cities? And whom are cities planned for?\n.\tHow are communities shaped by urban planning and policy?\n.\tWhy should we think about the different ways people experience, use, and are shaped by cities? And, \n.\tWhy does it matter to think about gender in the context of urban planning?\n\nThis course investigates a wide range of domestic and international topics that relate gender and sex to urban planning and policies. Urban planning is a broad, interdisciplinary field that is concerned with public space- approached from a variety of disciplines that consider various types of infrastructure \u0026 facilities (e.g., transportation, water \u0026 wastewater, communications, buildings \u0026 land development) and public policy (e.g., health, economic development, intergovernmental relationships, environmental policy).\n\nEach week, students will (a) read a significant work related to a gender and urban planning topic; (b) watch/experience/read a paired example from the popular media (e.g., TV, movies, podcast, recent news or opinion piece); (c) synthesize this information and think critically about concepts that society often takes as 'normal' and unquestioned, and; (d) respond and participate in discussions and short writing exercises. \n\nYou do not need to have previous knowledge about urban planning to succeed in this class. To pass you will need an interest in critical inquiry, an open mind, and the ability to dedicate sufficient time to reading and course work. My goals as the instructor of this course are to encourage critical thought, to provide foundational information on topics covered, and to further develop your academic writing skills.",

This course surveys international cities to help students understand the worldżs urban systems, global variations in urban environments, and the diversity in organization and functioning of cities. Using a case study methodology, the class compares and contrasts contemporary paths of urban development. Students gain an introduction to a variety of urban forms and approaches to sustaining the urban environment worldwide. \n\nThe class examines the interplay between human activities and land, water, and energy policies that shape the use of urban resources to produce the built environment. Students will be introduced to the tasks and methods of urban planning and consider what determines variations in urban design, land use, transportation, energy use, water consumption, infrastructure plans, economic development, and urban social functions. Students will learn about improving the quality of urban environments by comparing contemporary cities, both industrialized and developing cities.",

The first part will begin with an overview of core concepts in the philosophy of mental health/illness, which will be followed by a brief history of philosophical approaches to psychopathology. The second part of the course will be concerned with philosophical issues associated with particular types of psychopathology, such as psychosis, depression, mania, personality disorders, and addiction. The third and final part of the course will cover specific issues at the intersection of psychopathology and particular areas of philosophy, such as ethics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of mind. These intersecting issues include (respectively): moral/criminal responsibility of the mentally ill, causes, laws and reasons in psychiatric etiology, and personal identity issues associated with mental illness.",

Key to the cultural studies approach is the idea that gender, race/ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, class, and other subject positions organize identities, social relations and the objects and images that culture produces.  After a general introduction to these conceptual terms, our course surveys French and Italian fashion history from the 1500s to the present day. Students grapple with key questions of cultural history, beginning with an analysis of the reasons why Paris has been regarded for so long as \"the capital of fashion\". In recent decades, since the age of globalization, the geography of fashion has become more competitive with Milan, New York and London all vying for fashion capital status. However, the myth of Paris remains with us. To describe this magical mythical Paris is to imagine the place where all the refinements of civilized life reach their fullest expression from avant-garde art to elegant fashion.",

Focusing on topics including work, family, body, media, political organizing, and tourism, the course also explores how U.S. gender systems have shaped and been shaped by colonialism, capitalism, warfare, and interactions with people in other parts of the world, historically and now.",

Their experiences tell us something about the complex intersection of sex, gender, and religion in Latin America. This course takes an anthropological approach to consider two central questions: (1) What role do religious ideologies and institutions play in the social construction of sexuality and gender in Latin America? (2) How do Latin Americans enact and contest gender power relations through their religious practices, thus contributing to processes of social change in the region? To address these questions, this class focuses on gender and its relationship to sexual desires and transgressions across diverse religious traditions from the pre-Columbian period to the present.",

This seminar explores these basic questions through the lens of Japanese food culture: the dietary trends, choices, and ideas of proper consumption that help shape the relationship between people's bodies and the world around them. We will discuss how and why \"eating right\" became such an important issue in Japan from the seventeenth century to the present and ask what the everyday experience of eating can tell us about the core themes, concepts, and events in Japanese and East Asian history. By putting Japanese foodways in conversation with global gastronomy, we will investigate what makes food \"cultural\" and what makes it historical.",

                                "description": "This course explores the history and mythology surrounding one of the most iconic symbols of premodern Japan: the samurai. Comprising only six percent of the Japanese populace, the cultural prestige and historical memory of Japan's warrior elites far outweigh their undersized ranks. Yet much of samurai lore has also been romanticized, embellished, or even made up. Were the samurai loyal retainers or pragmatic power-grabbers? Were they stoic swordsman or struggling bureaucrats? Why do we care so much about the violent social world of the samurai, and how do our impressions of them diverge from what we know about the history of their rise, reign, and fall? How do ideas of the \"Way of the Warrior\" get reinterpreted and recycled in Japan today? This course investigates these questions in two broad units: The History of the Samurai in War and Peace; and Remembering and Reinventing the Samurai in Modern Japan. This course welcomes undergraduates of all interests and majors, and no prior knowledge of Japanese language or history is required. Additional materials in East Asian languages will be made available upon request.",

We will look at the work of human rights tribunals, non-governmental organizations, and activists.  Key questions include: what does it mean to do justice for the marginalized in society?  Should human rights institutions take extraordinary measures to listen to the voices of the marginalized? Will the voices of the marginalized be co-opted by existing power structures, thus rendering them even more marginalized?",

Between individuals and across cultures, the definitions and values of our heritages are as diverse as their contents are rich. Moreover, the democratization of photography as both an artistic and a documentary practice has significantly impacted the methods available to the scholars of heritage - broadly defined - and to the site interpreters engaged daily in preservation and public education. Here we use \"lens culture\" (the pervasiveness of the camera in the Western world) as a gateway to applying increasingly complex heritage concepts throughout the semester.\nThe course is divided into three major units:\n1. Heritage preservation theory, covering urban conservation efforts internationally and the American preservation movement, including contemporary issues and debates;\n2. Place-based photography as a heritage research tool, including repeat photography, street/public photography, visual anthropology approaches, and evolving ideas regarding authenticity/accuracy; and\n3. Models of place-making and heritage interpretation from different disciplines and cultures - in other words case studies applying theory and analyzing programs/policies/places - how what we do to our important sites reflects or manifests the way we internalize ideas of heritage.",

While the British invented \"football\" (as soccer is known around the world) and professional football, the French were key players in structuring it worldwide. Following in the steps of Pierre de Coubertin who revived the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century, French compatriots Jules Rimet, Robert Guérin, Henri Delaunay, Jacques de Ryswick, Gabriel Hanot, Jacques Goddet, and Jacques Ferran were central figures in the creation of the most important soccer institutions as of today: Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1904, the FIFA World Cup Soccer in 1930, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 1954, the UEFA Coupe d'Europe des Clubs Champions Européens (Champions League) in 1955, and the Ballon d'Or (Golden Ball Award) in 1956. The course provides a strong foundation in the history and development of soccer in France, the Francophone world, and as a worldwide global phenomenon through explorations in the following areas: cultural and global studies, philosophy, history, institutions, the arts, and language. \n\nThe course presents several important themes that will allow us to understand the popularity and identification of the populations with soccer worldwide, as well as the human values it represents: olympism, pacifism, imperialism, colonialism, national identities, race, politics, gender, and globalization.\n\nStudents will read and discuss some of the most important scholarly texts dealing with soccer.",

Key to the cultural studies approach is the idea that gender, race/ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, class, and other subject positions organize identities, social relations and the objects and images that culture produces.  After a general introduction to these conceptual terms, our course surveys French and Italian fashion history from the 1500s to the present day. Students grapple with key questions of cultural history, beginning with an analysis of the reasons why Paris has been regarded for so long as \"the capital of fashion\". In recent decades, since the age of globalization, the geography of fashion has become more competitive with Milan, New York and London all vying for fashion capital status. However, the myth of Paris remains with us. To describe this magical mythical Paris is to imagine the place where all the refinements of civilized life reach their fullest expression from avant-garde art to elegant fashion.",

This seminar explores these basic questions through the lens of Japanese food culture: the dietary trends, choices, and ideas of proper consumption that help shape the relationship between people's bodies and the world around them. We will discuss how and why \"eating right\" became such an important issue in Japan from the seventeenth century to the present and ask what the everyday experience of eating can tell us about the core themes, concepts, and events in Japanese and East Asian history. By putting Japanese foodways in conversation with global gastronomy, we will investigate what makes food \"cultural\" and what makes it historical.",

Comprising only six percent of the Japanese populace, the cultural prestige and historical memory of Japan's warrior elites far outweigh their undersized ranks. Yet much of samurai lore has also been romanticized, embellished, or even made up. Were the samurai loyal retainers or pragmatic power-grabbers? Were they stoic swordsman or struggling bureaucrats? Why do we care so much about the violent social world of the samurai, and how do our impressions of them diverge from what we know about the history of their rise, reign, and fall? How do ideas of the \"Way of the Warrior\" get reinterpreted and recycled in Japan today? This course investigates these questions in two broad units: The History of the Samurai in War and Peace; and Remembering and Reinventing the Samurai in Modern Japan. This course welcomes undergraduates of all interests and majors, and no prior knowledge of Japanese language or history is required. Additional materials in East Asian languages will be made available upon request.",

In so many ways, we are spectators, be it movies, TV shows, popular music, animation, video games, etc. Sometimes, we go beyond being just spectators and actively engage in producing, circulating, and re-creating such cultural forms as fans or users. How does popular culture affect the way in which we see our world and define who we are? How do the values of cultural industries become the dominant economic logic of our era? How does popular culture interact with politics? This course will allow us to explore these questions. The focus on Korea will offer us unique contexts in which we situate our questions and answers. We will use our personal experiences as motivation to delve deeper into this topic and consider an extensive range of Korean pop culture from music to drama, cinema, online gaming, and Internet culture.",

Reading ethnographic literature will be a tool to understand how class, gender, and family have been formed in Korea. Korea has transformed from one of the world's poorest agriculturally based countries to a postindustrial country in a very short time period. More than 80% of the entire population redefined itself as middle class, which shows Korean people's strong desire for upward mobility. Family has played an important role in realizing upward mobility and forming a middle-class identity. The gender-division of labor based on the separation between public and private spheres has functioned as an effective system for fast economic development while deepening gender discrimination. Marginalization of women has resulted in the abnormal growth of the private sphere where an extremely competitive education system and real estate speculation have been formed as family strategies for upward mobility. The particularity of Korean modernity can be found in the process of the interwoven formation of class, gender, and family.",

This broad question will be examined in specific areas in Brazil such as public health, urban and rural development, environment, education, law, politics, and pop culture. The course covers theoretical readings and case studies from different geographical areas. Instructional materials are interdisciplinary, drawing mainly on the fields of History, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, and Geography.",

Since independence, the United States has been a major player in the political and economic development of the Latin American region. Conversely, policies and events originating in Latin America shape politics and society in the United States. Course topics include U.S. foreign policy and policy impact on the Latin American region, Latin America's influence on hemispheric relations, and Latin America's diverse policy approaches to the United States and the world. \n\nThe course is organized to first provide students with a historical overview as a foundation for understanding contemporary U.S.-Latin American relations. The focus of the course then shifts to exploring the most critical contemporary policy issues. The course is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the history of U.S.-Latin American relations from Latin America's independence in the early 19th century, through the War on Terror that began in 2001. Part II focuses on five critical policy concerns that shape U.S.-Latin American relations in the 21st century: democracy, economic development, security, the environment, and migration. Students will engage in intense study of one of these policy issues to write an independent research paper, and work in groups to design and present a policy brief at the end of the term.",

Their experiences tell us something about the complex intersection of sex, gender, and religion in Latin America. This course takes an anthropological approach to consider two central questions: (1) What role do religious ideologies and institutions play in the social construction of sexuality and gender in Latin America? (2) How do Latin Americans enact and contest gender power relations through their religious practices, thus contributing to processes of social change in the region? To address these questions, this class focuses on gender and its relationship to sexual desires and transgressions across diverse religious traditions from the pre-Columbian period to the present.",

This course aims to guide students to investigate theories of learning and to help them begin to apply these concepts to their own learning. In the second half of the semester, we will investigate learning in social settings and discuss important factors to consider when supporting others' learning. Students will critically evaluate issues within educational systems that may positively or negatively influence learning. This course will be most applicable to students with a STEM major, as most of the discussion will focus on examples of learning topics in science and math. Many topics will focus on issues specific to learning in the sciences, including \"math anxiety\", \"science identity\", and \"integrating scientific practices and concepts\".",

These gaps frequently lead to food insecurity with a less healthy populous, as well as food waste, an issue in more developed societies. By examining 1) the food supply chain and markets, 2) food insecurity, 3) food loss and waste along the food supply chain and 4) food policies, students will gain insights into the economic forces that shape the food system. This course stimulates critical thinking and problem solving through economic and policy perspectives, which may lead to potential resolutions for those who struggle to afford and consume healthy, wholesome foods.",

Since independence, the United States has been a major player in the political and economic development of the Latin American region. Conversely, policies and events originating in Latin America shape politics and society in the United States. Course topics include U.S. foreign policy and policy impact on the Latin American region, Latin America's influence on hemispheric relations, and Latin America's diverse policy approaches to the United States and the world. \n\nThe course is organized to first provide students with a historical overview as a foundation for understanding contemporary U.S.-Latin American relations. The focus of the course then shifts to exploring the most critical contemporary policy issues. The course is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the history of U.S.-Latin American relations from Latin America's independence in the early 19th century, through the War on Terror that began in 2001. Part II focuses on five critical policy concerns that shape U.S.-Latin American relations in the 21st century: democracy, economic development, security, the environment, and migration. Students will engage in intense study of one of these policy issues to write an independent research paper, and work in groups to design and present a policy brief at the end of the term.",

Animals often play a central role in cultural metaphors and myths, but they are also physically present in homes and workplaces, and in local as well as global economies. Both levels in this complex web of relationships structure society in areas as varied as art, economy, entertainment, health, law, media, and science. However, the ways in which human society deals with its coexistence with animals, and the ways it interacts with, uses, and handles them; are complex and embedded in paradoxes that are often affected by structures of power. The purpose of this course is to stimulate critical reflections on different social constructions and the ethical and moral implications of human relationships with animals. Over the course of the semester we will: (1) examine the evolution of human/animal relationships over time, (2) consider the unique roles that different species play in human lives and the ways we treat them as a result, and (3) engage in interviews, personal reflections, argumentative essays, and research reports about human/animal relationships.",

Over the course of the semester, we will discuss the factors that have shaped the Russian criminal (thieves) world (vorovskoi mir) and its prison values and norms of behavior called \"poniatiia\", and the significance of criminal culture in contemporary Russia. Through examining the Yeltsin and Putin periods, we will explore the origins of the Russian oligarchy and the ways in which it has been interweaved into Russian politics. The topics to be investigated include the transformation of political and social institutions in the Soviet Union and Russia, the rise and (alleged) fall of the Russian mafia, social integration and disintegration, the key concepts of the Russian criminal world and its representation in contemporary pop culture, the evolution of the European penitentiary system over the centuries and the specifics of its Russian counterpart, the complex symbiotic relationship of the oligarchy with Putin's regime, and the paradoxical place of the criminal culture within the national consciousness.",

This course provides an in-depth study of food culture, traditional cuisine, agriculture, and żlocavoreż movements in Russian and American (particularly Sonoran) contexts. Through a variety of readings, films, lectures, and experiential learning activities, students will investigate the foodways and cultures of our two countries, with additional emphasis on contemporary issues of sustainability, environmental impact, and global interconnectedness.",

When most people think of this region today, images of the most recent wars and chaos of post-Communist times come to mind. However, hidden behind these images is a region rich in history and culture:  Viennese cafe culture meets the Mediterranean; world religions meet and intermingle, and the region's contemporary arts have influenced global culture.  In this class we will explore this region's turbulent history, cross-cultural interactions, and common traditions and customs.",

The first and foremost is to introducestudents to the history, concepts, and issues that define the intertwined intellectual movementsof phenomenology and existentialism. The second objective is to encourage students to thinkcritically about the relevant issues from a contemporary perspective. Such a perspective will besensitive not only to recent developments in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificialintelligence but also to changing attitudes toward technology, the environment, politics,sexuality, feminism, etc.) Students will be asked to critique arguments offered on behalf ofvarious positions, as well as to construct arguments for alternative positions. Importantly, suchcritiquing and constructing will be done from an appropriately informed perspective. Thus,before addressing specific issues in phenomenology and existentialism, students will beintroduced to defining historical movements as well as key concepts (e.g., intentionality,consciousness, authenticity, freedom, absurdity). A third and final objective is to encouragestudents to articulate, in clear and concise prose, their considered views concerning variousissues in phenomenology and existentialism. This will be achieved through frequent in-classwriting assignments and exams that include a substantive (take-home) essay component. Inboth cases, students will receive critical feedback and may also be asked to provide suchfeedback to fellow students.",

Food is central to cross-cultural studies of behavior, thought, and symbolism. This course explores the connections between what people in Latin America eat and who they are through cross-cultural study of Latin Americans' food production, preparation, and consumption. Readings are organized around critical discussions of what people cook and eat in Mexico, Tucson-Mexico Border, Caribbean, Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. A primary goal of the course is to provide students with theoretical and empirical tools to understand and evaluate the relationship between food, history, culture, and economy in Latin America at local and global levels.",

This class will explore how science is covered in media around the world and the effect popular press has on how people understand the scientific world around them. We'll look at both the strengths and weaknesses of science stories in the news, how journalists decide to cover a particular science story, and hear from both scientists and reporters about their roles. Students will develop a scientific literacy to evaluate media stories they consume in their lives.",

Drawing on perspectives from public health, the social/behavioral sciences, and perspectives from Africana Studies, we will engage in the comparative study of health cultures.  We will explore the historical and contemporary multilayered social, cultural, political, and economic systems that engender the social and cultural determinants that shape health status, health behavior and health inequalities of Africana peoples in the United States.",

Using a spatial perspective, we explore the history, economics, cultural, and environmental aspects of beer and brewing to better understand our world.  We'll explore the links of beer to colonization, globalization, and commodification; migration and national identities; the impact of transportation and technologies on the spatial economies of beer; consolidation, neolocalism, and beer tourism; the impact of climate change and the physical geographies of key ingredients such as hops, barley, and water.  Throughout the semester we'll use comparative perspectives provided by beverages such as cocoa, wine, coffee, whisk(e)y, and rum.",

From an anthropological perspective, the answers to these questions are important, but not straightforward. This Tier II undergraduate course combines medical and environmental anthropology with science and technology studies to develop a critical perspective on environmental health. Through readings, film, discussion, activities and guest lectures, course participants will explore three areas: 1) the history of toxic exposures, including major environmental disasters such as Chernobyl, Bhopal and Fukushima; 2) the politics of toxic exposures, including a discussion of how gradual economic and industrial development often results in the uneven distribution of toxic body burdens or \"slow violence\", and; 3) the uncertainty surrounding toxic exposures, including the contested illnesses and impure sciences that emerge from toxic settings around the world. Building on the foundations of Tier I anthropology courses, this course introduces students to the unique ways that anthropologists study environmental health, science, and activism.",

We will explore the historical and contemporary multilayered social, cultural, political, and economic systems that engender the social and cultural determinants that shape health status, health behavior and health inequalities of Africana peoples in the United States.",

Part of the resilience of black culture and black life is about imagining the impossible, imagining better places, situating oneself on different levels of existence and interacting with other life forms, be they alien, artificial or human, in ways not fully embraced or understood by Western culture. Afrofuturism encompasses art, music, literature, religion, technology and the future in new and exciting ways in order to further understand the human condition, more specifically the place of people of color in the 21st century and beyond. Overall, this course explores the construction of modern and future worlds from the perspective of global black experiences.",

Students will come to understand African American writers,  particularly women, as historical agents and self-defined individuals. While the course will emphasize the multiple roles of African American women, as portrayed autobiographically it also incorporates the historical struggles of those around them. It is my goal that through the course material students will see how African Americans are constantly recreating themselves in the face of adversity.",

Evidence of hipster slang is documented in Cab Calloways's \"Hepster's Dictionary\" in 1938. It is, according to linguistic anthropologist Robert L. Moore, the most popular slang term of approval in English. \n\"Cool\" more than a word. \nThis course investigates the idea of \"cool\" in America and its musical relationship to urban culture through various genres of African-­American music. The rise to prominence of \"cool\" will be analyzed through and investigation of the music of Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Armstrong, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, West Coast jazz, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Iggy Pop, The Ramones, Sugar Hill Gang, and Grandmaster Flash along with their music's effect on social mores, fashion, film, and literature.",

How are understandings and experiences of citizenship bound up with the definition and institutionalization of race/ethnicity, class, and gender? This broad question will be examined in specific areas in Brazil such as public health, urban and rural development, environment, education, law, politics, and pop culture. The course covers theoretical readings and case studies from different geographical areas. Instructional materials are interdisciplinary, drawing mainly on the fields of History, Anthropology, Sociology, Political Science, and Geography.",

By combining interactive learning, current and relevant readings, and key presenters, the course will help completers integrate more smoothly into the next phase of their lives.  As the world shrinks and we find ourselves playing roles in an increasingly diverse society, understanding the communication process and how culture, race and gender affect interpersonal communication becomes ever so more important for all of us.  The class will take an objective look at our own beliefs and the beliefs and systems espoused by our chosen disciplines.  The students who graduate today will create the way our fields operate in the future.",

Students will analyze a variety of media (in translation) from Eastern Europe that posit situations based in a \"fantastic\" space, time or world to compare how broader cultural concerns are expressed through the genre of science fiction. We will discuss the development of the genre in Eastern Europe from the era of Romanticism to the modern day, with emphasis on the historical-cultural context of the Space Race between the US and USSR and its impact on the genre. This course will explore the view \"from the East\" of such topics as progress, imperialism, human perfectibility, gender constructs, the nature of communication, human/other identity, and the limits of knowledge as humanity pushes further into the final frontier. Students will read all texts in translation; all films will be available with English-language subtitles.",

In the Soviet Union sport was not only a means of entertainment, but also a key element of state propaganda. Through sport, the new Soviet person was to be made.  By 1956, the Soviet Union took home more Olympic medals than the US team, setting the stage for a rivalry between capitalist and socialist states that would last throughout the Cold War era. This course will explore the birth of sport in Russia and Eastern Europe, trace how the Soviet system created a propaganda machine out of international sporting competition, and how the legacy continues into the modern day.  We will also discuss contemporary sporting issues- such as the recent doping scandals in the Russian Olympic team and Russia's hosting of the 2018 World Cup- to analyze how Russia currently uses sport as a projection of its power in the global arena.",

While most of these movements share a common commitment to promoting Islamic morality and resisting external forces, there is enormous diversity and change within what is generalised as \"Islamism\".  Student will learn to grasp the basic differences as well as overlaps in identity and approach between the major streams of contemporary political Islam with regard to popularity and location, preference for armed vs. political strategies, nationalism vs. Pan-Islamist orientation, sectarian attitudes, levels of pragmatism, etc.  Students are expected to be familiar with basic history, geography and religious terminology of the Muslim world prior to taking this course.",

This course explores relationships and encounters between Buddhism and the domains of religion, science, and medicine. It considers historical relationships between Buddhism and traditional medicine in Asia as well as contemporary Western discourses involving Buddhism in popular culture, psychology, and spirituality. Finally, it invites a critical approach to the current dialogue between Buddhism and science. In the process, it reveals hidden assumptions behind commodifying `mindfulness' and the quest to document the therapeutic impact of meditation upon health, happiness, and success in the modern age.  Students will have the opportunity to apply the ideas they have learned through analysis of relevant initiatives at the U of A such as the Neuropsychology, Emotion, and Meditation [NEM] Lab and the Center for Compassion Studies as well as of broader Tucson community events like the Gem Show.",

This course introduces students to the Persian civilization from a variety of approaches. This course will help students to engage with major historical and cultural developments in Persian history and civilization. In light of the disciplinary methodologies related to those fields, students will study the texts and material culture of Iran in order to understand historical, literary, and political developments within their social contexts. Eventually, students will gain an understanding of how Persia developed into a world power, how it was divided, and how it continued to exist as a cultural concept. Students will read texts in English, watch films, and experience music, dance, and food. Through a comparative and critical approach, the course will also examine the value and limitations of theoretical perspectives offered by related disciplines such as literary, political science, religion, and cultural studies. \n\nTeaching will include lectures, discussions, and learner-centered activities using cooperative learning techniques. There will be live and interactive performances in some of the sessions on food and dance. \n\nReadings will be accompanied by short video and/or audio clips. All learning materials including articles, chapters, films, audios, etc. will be uploaded on the course's website and D2L.",

This course introduces students to the Persian civilization from a variety of approaches. This course will help students to engage with major historical and cultural developments in Persian history and civilization. In light of the disciplinary methodologies related to those fields, students will study the texts and material culture of Iran in order to understand historical, literary, and political developments within their social contexts. Eventually, students will gain an understanding of how Persia developed into a world power, how it was divided, and how it continued to exist as a cultural concept. Students will read texts in English, watch films, and experience music, dance, and food. Through a comparative and critical approach, the course will also examine the value and limitations of theoretical perspectives offered by related disciplines such as literary, political science, religion, and cultural studies. \n\nTeaching will include lectures, discussions, and learner-centered activities using cooperative learning techniques. There will be live and interactive performances in some of the sessions on food and dance. \n\nReadings will be accompanied by short video and/or audio clips. All learning materials including articles, chapters, films, audios, etc. will be uploaded on the course's website and D2L.",

Much of this material is confusing, since often it is not clear what the authors think that happiness is. Is it feeling good? Is it having a positive attitude to the way you are now? Is it having a positive attitude to your life as a whole? Is it having a happy life? Can some people advise others on how to be happy? \n\nPhilosophers have been engaged with the search for happiness for two thousand years. They have asked what happiness is, and have explored different answers to the question, including some of the answers now being rediscovered in other fields. \n\nIn this course we will ask what happiness is, and examine critically the major answers to this question. Weżll look at the rich philosophical tradition of thinking about happiness, at contemporary answers, and also at some recent work in the social sciences. Weżll examine the contributions being made to the ongoing search to find out what happiness is, and how we can live happy lives.\n\nOverall course objectives/expected learning outcomes: \nThis course has two primary objectives:\nż\tTo introduce students to the theoretical nature of the question of the nature of happiness by presenting a representative sample of the primary historical and contemporary literature\nż\tTo enable students to think and write critically, logically and objectively about the philosophical issues pertaining to happiness.\nThese objectives will be approached through lectures, discussions and writing assignments informed by the assigned readings. Course outcomes will be assessed through substantial writing assignments, some of which will feature opportunities for students to revise their work in light of advice from the professor.",

We examine three main ways of thinking about ethics: those that focus one the outcomes of actions, those that focus on the nature of the actions themselves, and those that focus on the character of the one who acts. Students will gain a foundational knowledge that will serve as a solid background for more advanced work in ethics, as a resource for thinking about moral issues, and as a piece of general education valuable for understanding practical aspects of human life.",

Students will use project management and planning methods to write a project description, carry out an initial pilot version of the project, report on steps they have accomplished, and write a critical analysis of the project.",

Drawing from the linguistic, cultural, and philosophical traditions of the humanities, we will study what it means to function effectively as part of a diverse collaborative, from small, informal communities to large, formal organizations. In contrast to the largely empirical epistemologies and methodologies of the hard and social sciences, we will approach the concept of collaboration as a subject and reflection of the human condition, considering the different cultural elements that influence cooperation and the meanings human beings derive from cooperation. We will explore how cultural and personal concepts such as power distance, individualism, gender roles, and orientation to time, tasks, and relationships shape collaboration. Course topics include the qualities of diverse collaboratives, the relationship of cultural diversity to collaboration, questions of personality and identity in the workplace, and leadership and assessment in a multicultural context.",

This course introduces students to the Persian civilization from a variety of approaches. This course will help students to engage with major historical and cultural developments in Persian history and civilization. In light of the disciplinary methodologies related to those fields, students will study the texts and material culture of Iran in order to understand historical, literary, and political developments within their social contexts. Eventually, students will gain an understanding of how Persia developed into a world power, how it was divided, and how it continued to exist as a cultural concept. Students will read texts in English, watch films, and experience music, dance, and food. Through a comparative and critical approach, the course will also examine the value and limitations of theoretical perspectives offered by related disciplines such as literary, political science, religion, and cultural studies. \n\nTeaching will include lectures, discussions, and learner-centered activities using cooperative learning techniques. There will be live and interactive performances in some of the sessions on food and dance. \n\nReadings will be accompanied by short video and/or audio clips. All learning materials including articles, chapters, films, audios, etc. will be uploaded on the course's website and D2L.",

Plays will be read, discussed, analyzed from a literary and visual stance. This course may be applied toward the major or minor in Italian (please speak with an advisor for more information).

Korea has experienced a compressed modernity in reaction to complex international dynamics, which include colonialism, the Cold War, and globalization. Its rich historical and social particularities have been a valuable source for cultural products such as film production. Film enables us to see beyond our own experiences and reflect on our world and other people's lives through various aesthetic mediations. Through the medium of film, students will be able to learn about the country through vivid imagery. This course will also allow students to understand important issues related to class, gender, capitalism, and democracy that our contemporary world is facing using Korean films to illustrate these key concerns.",

From the radicals and reactionaries of Weimar Berlin to the student\nmovements of the 1960s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, German society has born witness to unprecedented traumatic and regenerative\nmoments of social crisis and creative rebellion.

For centuries, philosophers, theologians, playwrights, and poets writing in German have been grappling with the deeper questions of the human condition. From theologian Martin Luther to the political theorist Hannah Arendt, from the philologist Friedrich Nietzsche to the dancer Pina Bausch, German thinkers and dreamers have been exploring the possibilities and limitations of the human intellect in action. This course takes a wide-angle look at what German-speaking intellectual history can tell us about the world in 2013, and about the complex cultural and social history leading up to today.",

Students will gain a solid understanding of the patterns of resistance adopted by people of African descent during the modern era, beginning with the slave revolt in Haiti.  Their various modes of resistance will be considered in relationship to relevant institutions (political, social, cultural) as well as popular forms of expression (folk music, literature) and behavior (demonstrations). Students will also discover the defining aspects of European and Euro-American domination through the end of Apartheid, including the formulation of policies, major strategies employed and their consequences. Questions of race, ethnic origin and class relations are at issue throughout this course.",

To the degree that Africana Studies has long advocated for the inclusion of African American contributions and the documenting of historical racial struggles for diversity and social justice, Digital Africana Studies encourages critical yet productive engagements through literature, art, history and popular culture.",

We will read, discuss, and write about a diverse selection of Young Adult\nnovels in order to explore the many facets of this literature and to consider how it shapes our definitions and understandings of adolescence. We will consider the following questions: What purposes does adolescent/young adult literature serve in our culture and society? How do these texts represent and address the adolescent and the state of adolescence? How does this literature reflect and engage the social and cultural contexts in which it was written? How does this literature portray issues of national, cultural, racial, political, and/or sexual/gender identity?",

How do\nrepresentations of race, class, gender, and sexuality disseminated within these popular texts shape the way we come to see others and\nourselves? These are some of the guiding questions we will be exploring in our study of US popular culture. Through an examination of both\ncritical essays and primary texts, students in this course will learn not only how to critically read and interpret various cultural forms, but also will come to understand the ways in which popular culture structures our day to day lives.",

The dramatic plays and prose pieces produced\nduring these disparate literary periods share many thematic-and some conventional-points of contact that are often overlooked and\nconsequently not fully explored. Both English Renaissance and modern African-American authors addressed several critical issues such as\nmiscegenation, power (political, parental, social), class, sexuality, lineage, death, identity, passing, homosexuality/homosociality, and race. These common preoccupations will enable our productive crossing of various boundaries in class, most notably, the historical boundary between the texts a. Authors will include W.E.B. Du Bois, Suzan-Lori Parks, William Shakespeare, Adrienne Kennedy, Christopher Marlowe, James Baldwin, Nella Larsen, and Harriet Jacobs. ",

This course explores relationships and encounters between Buddhism and the domains of religion, science, and medicine. It considers historical relationships between Buddhism and traditional medicine in Asia as well as contemporary Western discourses involving Buddhism in popular culture, psychology, and spirituality. Finally, it invites a critical approach to the current dialogue between Buddhism and science. In the process, it reveals hidden assumptions behind commodifying `mindfulness' and the quest to document the therapeutic impact of meditation upon health, happiness, and success in the modern age.  Students will have the opportunity to apply the ideas they have learned through analysis of relevant initiatives at the U of A such as the Neuropsychology, Emotion, and Meditation [NEM] Lab and the Center for Compassion Studies as well as of broader Tucson community events like the Gem Show.",

While focusing primarily on China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, this course helps students understand what has been historically shared among these East Asian societies, and yet how East Asia has always been diverse and heterogeneous. In so doing, it also aims to engage students in debunking popular myths about East Asia -- particularly pre-modern East Asia -- as an exotic and homogeneous place, and understanding today's East Asia in its historical context.",

A comparative approach will be used so that students gain a sense of the shared cultural markers of these two civilizations, as well as their differences and the changes that took place in the Roman period. Topics to be considered are: house and home; clothing and body ornament; food and drink; partying and leisure activities; theater and spectacle; sport and competition; music and dance; shopping and money; schooling and children's lives; men's versus women's lives; the lives of slaves; and the worlds of artists and craftsmen.",

All of these stories are found in classic novels printed in sixteenth century. The exciting plots and plain-speech storyteller style of these novels have made them accessible in the original to readers even today. Increasingly, however, such stories have found fame throughout Asia and the world through popular culture and new media adaptations. In this course, we will examine both the originals (in translation) and the modern adaptations. We will explore the historical setting of the sixteenth- century Ming dynasty in which the novels were first created, as well as recent films and other cultural creations based on them. The aim will be to uncover the cultural dynamics that allow for such creativity and fluidity.\n\nTopics may include Chinese religions, print and popular culture, literary and cross-cultural adaptation, film, graphic novels/manga, video games, and taboos against sex and violence. Readings will be primarily in English; supplementary/alternative readings, including portions of the original texts as well as secondary scholarship, will be made available for readers of Asian languages upon request.",

A comparative approach will be used so that students gain a sense of the shared cultural markers of these two civilizations, as well as their differences and the changes that took place in the Roman period. Topics to be considered are: house and home; clothing and body ornament; food and drink; partying and leisure activities; theater and spectacle; sport and competition; music and dance; shopping and money; schooling and children's lives; men's versus women's lives; the lives of slaves; and the worlds of artists and craftsmen.",

To the degree that Africana Studies has long advocated for the inclusion of African American contributions and the documenting of historical racial struggles for diversity and social justice, Digital Africana Studies encourages critical yet productive engagements through literature, art, history and popular culture.",

Students will gain a solid understanding of the patterns of resistance adopted by people of African descent during the modern era, beginning with the slave revolt in Haiti.  Their various modes of resistance will be considered in relationship to relevant institutions (political, social, cultural) as well as popular forms of expression (folk music, literature) and behavior (demonstrations). Students will also discover the defining aspects of European and Euro-American domination through the end of Apartheid, including the formulation of policies, major strategies employed and their consequences. Questions of race, ethnic origin and class relations are at issue throughout this course.",

However, courses taught in the era of African enslavement have tended to focus on the northern most regions, such as Virginia, which are often taken to represent-if not constitute-the South. This course looks at the other \"South\" and the French and Spanish colonizers of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. It offers a different perspective of the beginnings of the Great Enslavement and compares and contrasts the lives and struggles of enslaved, freed, and self-emancipated Africans in the Southwest during the tenure of Spain.",

We will compare Eastern Orthodoxy to Western Christianity (Catholicism and Protestantism), and will examine various different national Churches within Eastern Orthodoxy (i.e., Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian, Modern Greek, the older \"Oriental\" Churches, etc.), with a primary focus on Russia.  Eastern Orthodox Christianity is often perceived as being one of the more 'mystical' of Christian traditions, and we will explore the Orthodox vision of 'the mystical life', examining its basis in history and contemporary experience.  We will also ask about the significance of Church doctrine and practice for the development of culture as a whole in the areas of the world in which Eastern Christianity predominates, and the ways in which that culture both differs from and relates to what we (perhaps inaccurately) call \"Western\" civilization. In general, Orthodox practice relies heavily on the senses, and the course is designed to be experiential.  To that end, we will make at least one field trip to a local Orthodox Church during the course of the semester.",

We will determine how writers and artists conceptualized commercial sex in French, Russian, and German contexts. For the era's writers, artists, thinkers, and social activists, the prostitute became linked with urban decay and the disastrous effects of industrialization. In our discussions of works by Alexandre Dumas fils, Emile Zola, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Frank Wedekind, we will uncover how these writers utilize the female body to discuss issues of deviance and attraction. In analyzing paintings by Edouard Manet, Ilya Repin, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, we will determine how the courtesan and streetwalker appear as emblems of modernity.",

To that end, we will make at least one field trip to a local Orthodox Church during the course of the semester.",

Our analytical lens will include political philosophers, nation-states and international organizations, but we will also pursue alternative visions and voices, exploring how human rights debates in the \"West\" were shaped by an uneasy tension with colonialism and slavery. The course explores the role of major governmental and non-governmental institutions in human rights activism, and analyzes emerging approaches to transnational geographies of justice. We will explore the ongoing contested boundaries of universal human rights protection, including gender and human rights; the collective rights of indigenous peoples; prisoners of war; and the rights of non-citizens within a global human rights regime still largely scripted by the dictates of national sovereignty.",

However, courses taught in the era of African enslavement have tended to focus on the northern most regions, such as Virginia, which are often taken to represent-if not constitute-the South. This course looks at the other \"South\" and the French and Spanish colonizers of  South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. It offers a different perspective of the beginnings of the Great Enslavement and compares and contrasts the lives and struggles of enslaved, freed, and self-emancipated Africans in the Southwest during the tenure of Spain.",

Students will learn about different styles of participatory community dancing as it is done throughout these regions. Students will learn about the contexts (celebrations, gatherings, weddings, etc.) in which dances are done and about how dance is used to establish social hierarchies, communicate cultural values, and mark dancers for cultural identity and ideology. \nThe exploration of dance as a form of individual and group expression will be fostered through movement, written assignments and discussions. Upon completing this course, students will acquire a deeper appreciation for the dance in traditional and modern folk cultures.",

Through a series of lectures and labs, we explore art practices including graffiti art, tattoos, and outsider art through documentary videos, directed readings, and studio projects.  Students are required to explore on and off campus venues to complete writing assignments, participate in discussions, and realize project goals.  \nIn each genre we will examine principle artists, vocabulary, and the cultural significance of the work produced. As a lecture/lab course, projects develop out of lecture materials and discussions, and are broadened through research-based experiences. This course will highlight the conceptual, technical, and visual foundations of underground art works.",

Students will learn about different styles of participatory community dancing as it is done throughout these regions. Students will learn about the contexts (celebrations, gatherings, weddings, etc.) in which dances are done and about how dance is used to establish social hierarchies, communicate cultural values, and mark dancers for cultural identity and ideology. \nThe exploration of dance as a form of individual and group expression will be fostered through movement, written assignments and discussions. Upon completing this course, students will acquire a deeper appreciation for the dance in traditional and modern folk cultures.",

Through a series of lectures and labs, we explore art practices including graffiti art, tattoos, and outsider art through documentary videos, directed readings, and studio projects.  Students are required to explore on and off campus venues to complete writing assignments, participate in discussions, and realize project goals.  \nIn each genre we will examine principle artists, vocabulary, and the cultural significance of the work produced. As a lecture/lab course, projects develop out of lecture materials and discussions, and are broadened through research-based experiences. This course will highlight the conceptual, technical, and visual foundations of underground art works.",

Students will learn about different styles of participatory community dancing as it is done throughout these regions. Students will learn about the contexts (celebrations, gatherings, weddings, etc.) in which dances are done and about how dance is used to establish social hierarchies, communicate cultural values, and mark dancers for cultural identity and ideology. \nThe exploration of dance as a form of individual and group expression will be fostered through movement, written assignments and discussions. Upon completing this course, students will acquire a deeper appreciation for the dance in traditional and modern folk cultures.",

Through a series of lectures and labs, we explore art practices including graffiti art, tattoos, and outsider art through documentary videos, directed readings, and studio projects.  Students are required to explore on and off campus venues to complete writing assignments, participate in discussions, and realize project goals.  \nIn each genre we will examine principle artists, vocabulary, and the cultural significance of the work produced. As a lecture/lab course, projects develop out of lecture materials and discussions, and are broadened through research-based experiences. This course will highlight the conceptual, technical, and visual foundations of underground art works.",

This spatial scale is compatible with such advanced tasks as manipulation of subcellular structures, interfacing cellular functions with electronics, assembly of biomimetic materials and devices, or synthetic biology. Such technologies may help develop new medical diagnostic tools or treatment modalities, augment impaired functions of the body or replace those that were lost as a result of injuries or congenital disorder.  This course will provide an overview of fundamental concepts underlying these technological advances, such as quantum mechanics, chemical kinetics, and materials science. Subsequently, experimental tools appropriate for working on the nanoscale will be introduced. Finally, the class will review applications of nanotechnology with particular focus on applications addressing biological and medical needs.",

During the first quarter of the semester, existing medical devices will be examined and analyzed. In the next half of the semester, students will build two to four devices in design modules. Students will first learn about the conceptual and practical aspects of a device and then implement that device. The modules will focus on technologies, such as microfluidics, electronics, flexible electronics, mechanical and micromechanical components, soft materials, sensors, optical elements, and software. For the last quarter of the course, students will compete in the design and testing of a medical device challenge.",

The methods are primarily motivated by the problems rather than the mathematics; however, sufficient mathematical and theoretical background will be provided for the students to acquire insight in the advantages and shortcomings of each technique. We will cover the concepts of numerical interpolation, linear algebra, numerical differentiation and integration, and numerical solution of differential equations. We will use computer programming to solve problems in science and engineering with a theme of biomechanics and mechanobiology.",

The course is divided into lectures during regular class time, hospital visits and grand rounds lectures. The regular classroom lectures are focused on hospital environment, patient flow, clinical regulations and applications of biomedical technologies. The hospital tours include visits of hospital units such endoscopy, radiology, operating room, ICU, pathology and various clinical units. Students will need to attend at least half of the organized hospital tours. Students will also need to attend grand rounds lectures discussing patient case studies. Hospital visits and grand rounds lectures will occur outside regular class hours and might also occur outside regular business hours. Hospital site is primarily the University Medical Center but might also include University satellites not on main campus. In order to be able to complete this course students will need to pass regulatory, safety and behavioral training at the beginning of the course. Students will have to complete immunizations required when working in a hospital environment.",

Korea has experienced a compressed modernity in reaction to complex international dynamics, which include colonialism, the Cold War, and globalization. Its rich historical and social particularities have been a valuable source for cultural products such as film production. Film enables us to see beyond our own experiences and reflect on our world and other people's lives through various aesthetic mediations. Through the medium of film, students will be able to learn about the country through vivid imagery. This course will also allow students to understand important issues related to class, gender, capitalism, and democracy that our contemporary world is facing using Korean films to illustrate these key concerns.",

In so many ways, we are spectators, be it movies, TV shows, popular music, animation, video games, etc. Sometimes, we go beyond being just spectators and actively engage in producing, circulating, and re-creating such cultural forms as fans or users. How does popular culture affect the way in which we see our world and define who we are? How do the values of cultural industries become the dominant economic logic of our era? How does popular culture interact with politics? This course will allow us to explore these questions. The focus on Korea will offer us unique contexts in which we situate our questions and answers. We will use our personal experiences as motivation to delve deeper into this topic and consider an extensive range of Korean pop culture from music to drama, cinema, online gaming, and Internet culture.",

Discussion of ancient Egypt, from its Mesolithic foundations in the savannahs of North Africa ca. 12,000 BCE through its Pharaonic Period and conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, is arranged in chronological and thematic units, each being placed in context of social, political, religious, and natural environments. For example, the course examines ancient creation myths, the diversity and origins of the gods, concept of the afterlife, religious symbolism of the built environment (temples, pyramids, tombs, etc.), and interconnections between other African, Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures. During the semester students will learn about core concepts that have long impacted Western cultures and will explore a world vastly different from their own. ",

Students will use project management and planning methods to write a project description, carry out an initial pilot version of the project, report on steps they have accomplished, and write a critical analysis of the project.",

Drawing from the linguistic, cultural, and philosophical traditions of the humanities, we will study what it means to function effectively as part of a diverse collaborative, from small, informal communities to large, formal organizations. In contrast to the largely empirical epistemologies and methodologies of the hard and social sciences, we will approach the concept of collaboration as a subject and reflection of the human condition, considering the different cultural elements that influence cooperation and the meanings human beings derive from cooperation. We will explore how cultural and personal concepts such as power distance, individualism, gender roles, and orientation to time, tasks, and relationships shape collaboration.

                        "description": "This beginning level hip- hop dance class combines straight lectures, lively discussions and problem solving with actual movement practice with the objective of equipping students the relevant cultural, historical and practical knowledge of hip-hop dance and cultures in general. This course takes off from the premise that hip-hop dance is a vital component of wider hip-hop cultures which contain both global and sub-national constituents. As such, it adopts a historical approach to explore the beginnings, influences and parallels of hip-hop dance in continental African, Caribbean, Latin American and local US cultures. The course proceeds to examine the different hip-hop dance and movement styles, techniques, vocabulary and cultures emanating from particular geographic regions especially the East Coast, West Coast, Midwest and the Deep South in the USA as well as hip-hop dance's current state of global popularity, cross-cultural appeal, production and consumption. The ultimate objective is to challenge and encourage students to create final dance projects where they apply knowledge acquired throughout the semester to demonstrate their understanding of the cultural, historical and practical knowledge of hip-hop dance and cultures in general. Most importantly, the course examines how hip-hop dance expressions and representations challenge and/or reinforce social constructs of race, gender, and class. As a combination lecture/studio class this course will focus on both theory and practice. Where possible the course will take advantage of Hip-Hop dancers and scholars residing in or visiting Arizona to deliver guest performances and workshop. Students are not required to have prior dance knowledge to enroll in this class and will participate at their ability levels. The class culminates in a research paper and an option to do a performance or a digital project.",

This course examines the violence of colonial encounters from the perspective of those indigenous groups who were colonized in Africa, North America, India, and the Caribbean. The goal of the course is to introduce students to Colonialism as a historical phenomenon and to critically analyze cross-cultural interactions in the past. Students will engage with different forms of primary data, including archaeological materials, literary works, and ethnography in order to analyze the inner workings of power and the impact of colonialism on the contemporary world. The class will involve a combination of lectures, reading-based discussions, and small-group activities.",

This course examines the various ways in which archaeologists investigate and interpret the death rituals of people in the past. Whether it be a pyramid built for a pharaoh or a pit filled with the anonymous skeletons of the poor and destitute, burial can tell us a lot. For the archaeologist, burials provide much information about beliefs and values; social divisions and status; kinship; health and diet; and identity. Drawing on case studies from a broad span of time periods and cultures, we will look at the evidence of tombs and monuments, inscriptions, grave goods, and skeletal remains to reconstruct how ancient societies confronted death.",

                        "description": "This course introduces students to fundamental questions in medical anthropology through an engagement with surgical procedures that remake the body and its world. A practice at once familiar and strange, we center surgical interventions to ground abstract concepts of social and political relations firmly in the materiality of the human body. We examine the concepts of belief and belonging through analyzing male circumcision; cultural relativism and its limits through female genital cutting; the constitution of race through cosmetic procedures that reshape the eyes and nose; nationalism and patriotism through the rehabilitation of soldiers' bodies; the constitution of sex and gender through trans- and intersex genital surgeries; the ethical pull of kinship through in-family kidney donation; economic globalization through surgical tourism; and the concept of the individual subject through post-amputation phantom limb pain and the medical imperative to separate conjoined twins. These procedures invite us to consider the body as a site at which particular ideas about what is \"normal\" and what is \"good\" quite literally find their form. They make manifest the economic, racial, political and ethical forces through which contemporary life and value unfold. Building on the foundations of Tier I anthropology courses, this course introduces students to the unique ways that anthropology engages the practices and beliefs at the heart of medicine. This is a Tier II GenEd course.",

More than only the respective \"rise and fall\" of each empire, we will examine how the rulers of each civilization depicted and justified their policies of conquest, how the pursuit of empire changed the cultures of these civilizations, and how each empire paved the way for the next. In the end, we will be learning how empires in general (mis)function, and how empires are justified to their participants, subjects, and enemies.",

Select texts analyzing myth as well as works of fiction and contemporary film and television will round out the course as students work toward analyzing their own cosmology, a chosen mythology, or develop their own unique mythology for the digital age. Particular emphasis will be paid to myths and cosmologies of groups in conflict and an analysis of the clash resulting from competing perspectives.",

                        "description": "This course introduces students to the study of play, from ancient games of chance to cutting edge playgrounds like amusement parks, escape rooms, and even workplaces. Students will learn and practice a set of critical and practical skills designed to help them both understand how play regularly changes the world around them, and how to use play as a tool for personal, professional, and political transformation. Over the course of the semester, we will: 1) survey the origins of play, paying particular attention to how the act of play is used to change or solidify the status quo; 2) examine research-informed case studies to learn and practice techniques for theorizing about how and why play does real work in the world; and 3) experiment with a variety of tools and techniques for using play to alter how individuals, communities, and organizations interact.",

Since independence, the United States has been a major player in the political and economic development of the Latin American region. Conversely, policies and events originating in Latin America shape politics and society in the United States. Course topics include U.S. foreign policy and policy impact on the Latin American region, Latin America's influence on hemispheric relations, and Latin America's diverse policy approaches to the United States and the world. \n\nThe course is organized to first provide students with a historical overview as a foundation for understanding contemporary U.S.-Latin American relations. The focus of the course then shifts to exploring the most critical contemporary policy issues. The course is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the history of U.S.-Latin American relations from Latin America's independence in the early 19th century, through the War on Terror that began in 2001. Part II focuses on five critical policy concerns that shape U.S.-Latin American relations in the 21st century: democracy, economic development, security, the environment, and migration. Students will engage in intense study of one of these policy issues to write an independent research paper, and work in groups to design and present a policy brief at the end of the term.",

                        "description": "Migration is a phenomenon of central interest and an important area of study in the social sciences. It has also become a fiercely debated politic topic in the United States and across the globe. This course will examine theories of migration (who migrates? why do people migrate? where do they go?) and attempt to answer these questions empirically. We will then analyze key debates about the consequences of migration for sending countries and receiving countries alike. We will subsequently examine the varied experiences of migrants, paying particular attention to the United States context. Here, theories of immigrant assimilation as well as economic, sociocultural, and demographic accounts will be assessed. This course will conclude by highlighting immigration policies, international security, and the refugee experience.",

This course explores relationships and encounters between Buddhism and the domains of religion, science, and medicine. It considers historical relationships between Buddhism and traditional medicine in Asia as well as contemporary Western discourses involving Buddhism in popular culture, psychology, and spirituality. Finally, it invites a critical approach to the current dialogue between Buddhism and science. In the process, it reveals hidden assumptions behind commodifying `mindfulness' and the quest to document the therapeutic impact of meditation upon health, happiness, and success in the modern age.  Students will have the opportunity to apply the ideas they have learned through analysis of relevant initiatives at the U of A such as the Neuropsychology, Emotion, and Meditation [NEM] Lab and the Center for Compassion Studies as well as of broader Tucson community events like the Gem Show.",

However, horror films can help us answer many important questions: what has scared us, throughout history? How do our individual backgrounds shape what scares us? What can similarities and differences among horror films from different parts of the world tell us about different cultures? How do filmmakers employ film style and narration to most effectively scare us? And why do we like to be scared in the first place? To help answer these questions, we will study a variety of horror films from different countries and time periods.",

Students will gain a solid understanding of the patterns of resistance adopted by people of African descent during the modern era, beginning with the slave revolt in Haiti.  Their various modes of resistance will be considered in relationship to relevant institutions (political, social, cultural) as well as popular forms of expression (folk music, literature) and behavior (demonstrations). Students will also discover the defining aspects of European and Euro-American domination through the end of Apartheid, including the formulation of policies, major strategies employed and their consequences. Questions of race, ethnic origin and class relations are at issue throughout this course.",

                        "description": "A survey of the literary treatment of erotic or amorous love in the Japanese tradition from the 7th to the 20th centuries. It is both a chronological introduction to the literary tradition and also an investigation of Japanese conceptions of love. The development of images of love in western literature has been analyzed in relation to the actions of the Christian church of the 12th century, resulting in a polarity between pure love and physical lust. In Japan we see a quite different development responding to Shinto, Buddhist and Confucian world-views, to changing social and political organization, and to advances in technology. The raw materials of the course are English language translations of Japanese literature and art from the major genres and periods between the 8th and 19th centuries.",

Drawing on perspectives from public health, the social/behavioral sciences, and perspectives from Africana Studies, we will engage in the comparative study of health cultures.  We will explore the historical and contemporary multilayered social, cultural, political, and economic systems that engender the social and cultural determinants that shape health status, health behavior and health inequalities of Africana peoples in the United States.",

While the British invented \"football\" (as soccer is known around the world) and professional football, the French were key players in structuring it worldwide. Following in the steps of Pierre de Coubertin who revived the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century, French compatriots Jules Rimet, Robert Guérin, Henri Delaunay, Jacques de Ryswick, Gabriel Hanot, Jacques Goddet, and Jacques Ferran were central figures in the creation of the most important soccer institutions as of today: Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1904, the FIFA World Cup Soccer in 1930, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 1954, the UEFA Coupe d'Europe des Clubs Champions Européens (Champions League) in 1955, and the Ballon d'Or (Golden Ball Award) in 1956. The course provides a strong foundation in the history and development of soccer in France, the Francophone world, and as a worldwide global phenomenon through explorations in the following areas: cultural and global studies, philosophy, history, institutions, the arts, and language. \n\nThe course presents several important themes that will allow us to understand the popularity and identification of the populations with soccer worldwide, as well as the human values it represents: olympism, pacifism, imperialism, colonialism, national identities, race, politics, gender, and globalization.\n\nStudents will read and discuss some of the most important scholarly texts dealing with soccer.",

Students will gain a solid understanding of the patterns of resistance adopted by people of African descent during the modern era, beginning with the slave revolt in Haiti.  Their various modes of resistance will be considered in relationship to relevant institutions (political, social, cultural) as well as popular forms of expression (folk music, literature) and behavior (demonstrations). Students will also discover the defining aspects of European and Euro-American domination through the end of Apartheid, including the formulation of policies, major strategies employed and their consequences.

It is my goal that through the course material students will see how African Americans are constantly recreating themselves in the face of adversity.",

While focusing primarily on China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, this course helps students understand what has been historically shared among these East Asian societies, and yet how East Asia has always been diverse and heterogeneous. In so doing, it also aims to engage students in debunking popular myths about East Asia -- particularly pre-modern East Asia -- as an exotic and homogeneous place, and understanding today's East Asia in its historical context.",

Key to the cultural studies approach is the idea that gender, race/ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, class, and other subject positions organize identities, social relations and the objects and images that culture produces.  After a general introduction to these conceptual terms, our course surveys French and Italian fashion history from the 1500s to the present day. Students grapple with key questions of cultural history, beginning with an analysis of the reasons why Paris has been regarded for so long as \"the capital of fashion\". In recent decades, since the age of globalization, the geography of fashion has become more competitive with Milan, New York and London all vying for fashion capital status. However, the myth of Paris remains with us. To describe this magical mythical Paris is to imagine the place where all the refinements of civilized life reach their fullest expression from avant-garde art to elegant fashion.",

                        "description": "This course considers French culture from the worldview of the French Revolutionary period to the present day.   Although this is a survey of French culture, when I use the word \"culture,\" I take it to mean more than just national culture.   After all, culture can and does cut across national boundaries.  Therefore, we will study the culture of France and its people not only from the outlook of the Parisian metropole, but also within local regional and global contexts.  \n\nWe begin by studying the intellectual, political and social processes that culminated in the Revolution of 1789.  You will engage with various interpretations of the Revolution proposed by contemporary scholars.  As the course continues, you will develop a particular understanding of the Revolution in terms of what cultural theorists call symbolic action.  From Napoleon's defeat to the Paris Commune to the dark years of Vichy France and the postwar recovery that followed, this approach will allow us to analyze how certain cultural symbols of the Revolution and their representations have shaped divisions within French political culture over time. When we consider the Revolution in this way, we encounter the theme of French collective memory. We ask certain questions among others such as 1) How has the French past shaped the political differences of the present? 2) How have rival interpretations of a historical event or figure served or undermined the interests of various political communities?  \n\nIn terms of social history, we say that culture is also to be found within the intersection of cultural identities such as gender, race, class and sexuality.  Whether we are studying 19th century representations of the \"unruly\" women of the Paris Commune or the \"dangerous\" subterranean world of the sewers of Paris, or entertainers and artists of the fin de sičcle period, we will analyze both production and reception of cultural values in French society. Throughout the course, you are encouraged to think about French culture from multiple perspectives.  \n\nBy the second half of the course, we will grapple with the complexities of French culture in the age of globalization, considering the problems of colonial legacies and French national \"heritage.\"  We will ask: In what ways has globalization challenged the traditional model of Republicanism, so integral to French political culture?  To answer this question and others, our texts will allow us to analyze French political structures and national identity through the history of French imperialism and regionalism.  We will pay special attention to the failure of the reintegration of former African colonies, in particular, after Algerian independence.  \n\nWhile much of our reading material is based on historical monographs, you will also read works of fiction and analyze films.  In addition, students in this course will have the opportunity to conduct research on a topic of their choice and write a longer paper based on findings.  At the end of this course, it is hoped that all will have a better understanding of the collective construction of the French past as well as come to appreciate the intricate mosaic that constitutes French cultural identity.",

After studying classical and scholarly approaches to studying the idea of the Mediterranean, interactive and ecologizing, in the longue durée and microhistories, we shall explore the culture and history of Mediterranean cities and their societies.  Our exploration traces ethnic and religious diversity, cultural, economic, political exchange and the history and representation of built environments. We consider the ways in which the city has been imagined in French, Italian and English literature. As the course unfolds, students engage with cultural ideas that have long captured the imagination of writers worldwide. We study the city as a dreamscape \"cité pleine de ręves,\" and move on to trace literary conceptions of travel, the Grand Tour and the seduction of the Mediterranean city and the northern tourist.  Following our close study of Venice mentalities, our course traces the history of networks and connectivity within medieval and early modern Mediterranean milieus. Aside from the familiar city-states and ports of call, we study in depth the free port city of Livorno and Jewish Sephardi diaspora.  Units follow on colonialism and post-colonialism in the North African Mediterranean city intertwined with cinematic narratives of the region.  Final units of the course trace the aesthetic, architectural, photographic representations of Mediterranean urban modernism from Mussoliniżs imprimatur on the landscape of Rome to the extraordinary developments of twentieth century art, architecture and urban design in Marseilles. To engage with contemporary issues, in the final unit we study representations of the cultural impact of migration on the region reading from Algerian born Italian author Amara Lakhous.  It is hoped that by the end of the course, students will have developed a foundational grasp of the Mediterranean city from the French and Italian perspectives and learned to distinguish among intertwining ideas of regional and national politics, economies, colonial and post-colonial imaginaries and myths and popular culture.",

More than only the respective \"rise and fall\" of each empire, we will examine how the rulers of each civilization depicted and justified their policies of conquest, how the pursuit of empire changed the cultures of these civilizations, and how each empire paved the way for the next. In the end, we will be learning how empires in general (mis)function, and how empires are justified to their participants, subjects, and enemies.",

                        "description": "Pyramids and Mummies focuses on the person and role of the king in ancient Egypt, exploring questions about individuals and their role(s) within and shaping their society. In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh was simultaneously a religious, political, economic, and legal institution. This course illuminates and critically examines the duties of the pharaoh and the lives of the individual men and women who occupied this exclusive class, which was perhaps the most powerful monarchy in human history. Frequently seen in the popular imagination as the superlative example of the \"Oriental despot\" stereotype (and often inviting comparisons with modern political figures), the Egyptian kingship was rather laden with responsibility. As a divine son (or, occasionally, daughter), a king was, hypothetically, priest of all the gods. Most important of these royal duties was the perpetuation of order on social and cosmic levels. The wealth of the country flowed both to and from the pharaoh, who was also, in the ideal, responsible for the importation of foreign goods as either tribute or booty. How kings achieved all of this \"and what exactly was expected of him or her\"; varied through three thousand years of pharaonic history. Within Egypt, society changed. Beyond Egypt, the political and economic fortunes of its neighbors changed. The course will cover kingship in Egypt from its ill-understood beginnings among prehistoric tribal chiefdoms, through the surprisingly early climax of royal power manifested by the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza, to the development of mummification as a form to preserve the king's body for eternity, into its travails and final usurpation by Greek rulers.",

                        "description": "For centuries, Chinese people have thrilled to the adventures of characters such as the Monkey King, Lord Guan, and Wu Song the tiger killer. All of these stories are found in classic novels printed in sixteenth century. The exciting plots and plain-speech storyteller style of these novels have made them accessible in the original to readers even today. Increasingly, however, such stories have found fame throughout Asia and the world through popular culture and new media adaptations. In this course, we will examine both the originals (in translation) and the modern adaptations. We will explore the historical setting of the sixteenth- century Ming dynasty in which the novels were first created, as well as recent films and other cultural creations based on them. The aim will be to uncover the cultural dynamics that allow for such creativity and fluidity.\n\nTopics may include Chinese religions, print and popular culture, literary and cross-cultural adaptation, film, graphic novels/manga, video games, and taboos against sex and violence. Readings will be primarily in English; supplementary/alternative readings, including portions of the original texts as well as secondary scholarship, will be made available for readers of Asian languages upon request.",

The dramatic plays and prose pieces produced during these disparate literary periods share many thematic-and some conventional-points of contact that are often overlooked and consequently not fully explored. Both English Renaissance and modern African-American authors addressed several critical issues such as miscegenation, power (political, parental, social), class, sexuality, lineage, death, identity, passing, homosexuality/homosociality, and race. These common preoccupations will enable our productive crossing of various boundaries in class, most notably, the historical boundary between the texts a. Authors will include W.E.B. Du Bois, Suzan-Lori Parks, William Shakespeare, Adrienne Kennedy, Christopher Marlowe, James Baldwin, Nella Larsen, and Harriet Jacobs.",

The concept of the border will be addressed as both a political reality and an imaginative construct - an organizing principle for our desire to seek and transmit diverse experiences and knowledge-systems across thresholds. The guiding question for this course will be, what does it mean to be a crosser of borders? In order to answer this question in its widest sense, we will operate in an intermediate space between academic discipline and community engagement, research and creative practice. Authors will include: Gloria Anzaldúa, Junot Diaz, Karen Tei Yamashita, C.S. Giscombe, Mahmoud Darwish, and more.",

Since the country's founding, immigrants have expanded ethnic and religious diversity in the United States in the face of powerful anti-immigrant movements. Students will engage with in-depth studies of immigrant communities who shaped the American religious and ethnic landscape, including diverse American expressions of religions such as Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Evangelical Protestantism, and Vodou.",

                        "description": "This course looks at both sides of the U.S.-Latin American relationship. Since independence, the United States has been a major player in the political and economic development of the Latin American region. Conversely, policies and events originating in Latin America shape politics and society in the United States. Course topics include U.S. foreign policy and policy impact on the Latin American region, Latin America's influence on hemispheric relations, and Latin America's diverse policy approaches to the United States and the world. \n\nThe course is organized to first provide students with a historical overview as a foundation for understanding contemporary U.S.-Latin American relations. The focus of the course then shifts to exploring the most critical contemporary policy issues. The course is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the history of U.S.-Latin American relations from Latin America's independence in the early 19th century, through the War on Terror that began in 2001. Part II focuses on five critical policy concerns that shape U.S.-Latin American relations in the 21st century: democracy, economic development, security, the environment, and migration. Students will engage in intense study of one of these policy issues to write an independent research paper, and work in groups to design and present a policy brief at the end of the term.",

To bring these ideas into sharper focus, we will pay attention to the ways that boundaries between humans, animals, and machines are constructed, and how they are broken down. Topics may include assisted reproduction, biotechnology, biological bodily differences, cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries, intersex and transgender issues, queer theory, sexual diversity in nature, sex toys, robotics, artificial intelligence, biopolitics and other similar issues.",

Students will read/view, critically analyze and apply a variety of multimodal sources (e.g., films, documentaries, video clips, scholarly work, magazine articles, charts, and reputable institutional websites). The course will foreground issues of power and privilege and the ways in which socially constructed factors, such as race, ethnicity, class (socio-economic status), sexual identities, and other socially constructed factors, interact with educational (mis)opportunities and (under)achievement. The course also provides opportunities for students to analyze, their own educational experiences- from a critical perspective. Course goals include: 1) to develop students' critical and quantitative literacy skills (through the integration of quantitative charts that relate to the course topics), and 2) to make connections between various historical events and present-day educational issues and concerns.",

Over the course of the semester, we will discuss the factors that have shaped the Russian criminal (thieves) world (vorovskoi mir) and its prison values and norms of behavior called \"poniatiia\", and the significance of criminal culture in contemporary Russia. Through examining the Yeltsin and Putin periods, we will explore the origins of the Russian oligarchy and the ways in which it has been interweaved into Russian politics. The topics to be investigated include the transformation of political and social institutions in the Soviet Union and Russia, the rise and (alleged) fall of the Russian mafia, social integration and disintegration, the key concepts of the Russian criminal world and its representation in contemporary pop culture, the evolution of the European penitentiary system over the centuries and the specifics of its Russian counterpart, the complex symbiotic relationship of the oligarchy with Putin's regime, and the paradoxical place of the criminal culture within the national consciousness.",

This means that one's zip code can be more important than their genetic code. Today's complex environmental science problems have far-reaching impacts and require an understanding of natural sciences, health, and justice. This course addresses this challenge by exploring and focusing on how to generate environmental science solutions at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, and community levels. Students will not only gain a fundamental understanding of the natural sciences, health, and justice, they will learn how to apply the science to solve real world problems. Through the lens of environmental justice, this class will emphasize race, socioeconomics, and gender to explore the ways in which diverse individuals and societies are generating solutions to environmental quality and health challenges. The course will focus on the United States but will incorporate case studies from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and/or Middle East.",

This course explores relationships and encounters between Buddhism and the domains of religion, science, and medicine. It considers historical relationships between Buddhism and traditional medicine in Asia as well as contemporary Western discourses involving Buddhism in popular culture, psychology, and spirituality. Finally, it invites a critical approach to the current dialogue between Buddhism and science. In the process, it reveals hidden assumptions behind commodifying `mindfulness' and the quest to document the therapeutic impact of meditation upon health, happiness, and success in the modern age.  Students will have the opportunity to apply the ideas they have learned through analysis of relevant initiatives at the U of A such as the Neuropsychology, Emotion, and Meditation [NEM] Lab and the Center for Compassion Studies as well as of broader Tucson community events like the Gem Show.",

Key to the cultural studies approach is the idea that gender, race/ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, class, and other subject positions organize identities, social relations and the objects and images that culture produces.  After a general introduction to these conceptual terms, our course surveys French and Italian fashion history from the 1500s to the present day. Students grapple with key questions of cultural history, beginning with an analysis of the reasons why Paris has been regarded for so long as \"the capital of fashion\". In recent decades, since the age of globalization, the geography of fashion has become more competitive with Milan, New York and London all vying for fashion capital status. However, the myth of Paris remains with us. To describe this magical mythical Paris is to imagine the place where all the refinements of civilized life reach their fullest expression from avant-garde art to elegant fashion.",

After studying classical and scholarly approaches to studying the idea of the Mediterranean, interactive and ecologizing, in the longue durée and microhistories, we shall explore the culture and history of Mediterranean cities and their societies.  Our exploration traces ethnic and religious diversity, cultural, economic, political exchange and the history and representation of built environments. We consider the ways in which the city has been imagined in French, Italian and English literature. As the course unfolds, students engage with cultural ideas that have long captured the imagination of writers worldwide. We study the city as a dreamscape \"cité pleine de ręves,\" and move on to trace literary conceptions of travel, the Grand Tour and the seduction of the Mediterranean city and the northern tourist.  Following our close study of Venice mentalities, our course traces the history of networks and connectivity within medieval and early modern Mediterranean milieus. Aside from the familiar city-states and ports of call, we study in depth the free port city of Livorno and Jewish Sephardi diaspora.  Units follow on colonialism and post-colonialism in the North African Mediterranean city intertwined with cinematic narratives of the region.  Final units of the course trace the aesthetic, architectural, photographic representations of Mediterranean urban modernism from Mussoliniżs imprimatur on the landscape of Rome to the extraordinary developments of twentieth century art, architecture and urban design in Marseilles. To engage with contemporary issues, in the final unit we study representations of the cultural impact of migration on the region reading from Algerian born Italian author Amara Lakhous.  It is hoped that by the end of the course, students will have developed a foundational grasp of the Mediterranean city from the French and Italian perspectives and learned to distinguish among intertwining ideas of regional and national politics, economies, colonial and post-colonial imaginaries and myths and popular culture.",

                        "description": "This interdisciplinary course is about the emergence and growing notoriety of soccer in France, the Francophone world, and the rest of the planet. While the British invented \"football\" (as soccer is known around the world) and professional football, the French were key players in structuring it worldwide. Following in the steps of Pierre de Coubertin who revived the Olympic Games at the end of the 19th century, French compatriots Jules Rimet, Robert Guérin, Henri Delaunay, Jacques de Ryswick, Gabriel Hanot, Jacques Goddet, and Jacques Ferran were central figures in the creation of the most important soccer institutions as of today: Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1904, the FIFA World Cup Soccer in 1930, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 1954, the UEFA Coupe d'Europe des Clubs Champions Européens (Champions League) in 1955, and the Ballon d'Or (Golden Ball Award) in 1956. The course provides a strong foundation in the history and development of soccer in France, the Francophone world, and as a worldwide global phenomenon through explorations in the following areas: cultural and global studies, philosophy, history, institutions, the arts, and language. \n\nThe course presents several important themes that will allow us to understand the popularity and identification of the populations with soccer worldwide, as well as the human values it represents: olympism, pacifism, imperialism, colonialism, national identities, race, politics, gender, and globalization.\n\nStudents will read and discuss some of the most important scholarly texts dealing with soccer.",

We will explore the different roles that these mind-altering substances played within various religious and medical traditions and investigate the role of Cannabis, psychedelics and alcohol within the economic, social and political realms of antiquity. In order to do this, we will read portions of primary texts in translation and learn to interpret visual and material culture. The primary focus will be to understand how these psychotropic substances were employed within all aspects of society. By understanding the various uses of psychotropic substances in a comparative context, students may better understand how to think critically about the role of drugs beyond their recreational use, thereby fostering an understanding of different cultures and their uses of psychotropics.",

Focusing on Canada, the United States, and the U.S.-Mexico border region, students will examine the historical and contemporary lived experiences of ethnic communities within North America through analysis of their sounding cultures. Musical case studies provide the pathway to understand culture, develop skill in the critical analysis of musical sound and performance, and identify the interconnections of music with the lives, histories, politics, and beliefs of the people and societies which make and consume it. This will be accomplished through reading, listening, and writing assignments, as well as musical performance workshops, media, and direct engagement with cultural practitioners and scholars.",

Yet in that brief period of time it has spread throughout the world and its popularity is near-universal.  In this course we will trace the evolution of the bicycle in four distinct ways: as a transportation device, with a gendered component; as a site for the development of human technology; as a commodity for economic development; and as a device for human pleasure, leisure time, and exercise.  We will explore its invention, growth, and development from the nineteenth through the twenty-first centuries in societies around the world.  We will survey important developments in the history of the bicycle from approximately 1850 to the present.",

Students will come to understand African American writers,  particularly women, as historical agents and self-defined individuals. While the course will emphasize the multiple roles of African American women, as portrayed autobiographically it also incorporates the historical struggles of those around them. It is my goal that through the course material students will see how African Americans are constantly recreating themselves in the face of adversity.",

                        "description": "This course explores social, cultural, and political currents in Asia from the fifteenth century to the present. Asia is far too large and diverse to be studied thoroughly in one single semester, and thus this course will serve as an introduction to a number of important themes and topics in the study of East, South, and Southeast Asia. In particular, we will focus on the dynamic movement of people and ideas to investigate multiple sites of interaction within Asia and between Asia and other parts of the world. We will begin with an exploration of the Mughal and Manchu empires in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and conclude with the popularity of Indian Bollywood and Japanese Anime in the twenty-first-century United States. \n\nBecause this is a course that traces both the outlines of Asian history but also, and perhaps more importantly, the interaction of Asian cultures with global trends and patterns as well as the construction of 'Asia' in the rest of the world, the texts we will read are not restricted to archival sources from Asia. You will use first-hand accounts, film, literature, and material artifacts to trace the development and significance of various trans-cultural connections that have shaped histories and identities within Asia and around the world.",

We will explore the different ways that the religious traditions of South Asia understand supernatural beings and forces. In order to do this we will read portions of primary texts in translation, examine iconography, and watch rituals as they unfold. In addition to learning about the South Asia traditions, we will put those conceptions of the divine in conversation with those rooted in a European context, forcing you to learn to think critically about the ways people from different cultures view the world around them.",

Since independence, the United States has been a major player in the political and economic development of the Latin American region. Conversely, policies and events originating in Latin America shape politics and society in the United States. Course topics include U.S. foreign policy and policy impact on the Latin American region, Latin America's influence on hemispheric relations, and Latin America's diverse policy approaches to the United States and the world. \n\nThe course is organized to first provide students with a historical overview as a foundation for understanding contemporary U.S.-Latin American relations. The focus of the course then shifts to exploring the most critical contemporary policy issues. The course is divided into two parts. Part I outlines the history of U.S.-Latin American relations from Latin America's independence in the early 19th century, through the War on Terror that began in 2001. Part II focuses on five critical policy concerns that shape U.S.-Latin American relations in the 21st century: democracy, economic development, security, the environment, and migration. Students will engage in intense study of one of these policy issues to write an independent research paper, and work in groups to design and present a policy brief at the end of the term.",

This course is designed to examine Confucianism in Asia through education, and the importance of ritual and propriety. Beginning at the beginning, with the life of Confucius in the 6th century BCE and the principle text that bears his name, the Analects, we will explore the central ideas of Confucianism and their adoption and adaptation by different Asian societies at different times. We will end with a consideration of issues in contemporary Asia and among the Asian-American population in the U.S. that demonstrate the continued importance of this way of thought.",

We will examine the religious symbolism of ancient Chinese bronze vessels, Chinese theories of nature based on concepts like Yin and Yang, the great medieval religions of Taoism and Buddhism, and other topics. Over the semester you will learn to think more like the Chinese of centuries past to exercise your imagination, and to explore a world that is different from your own.",

Students will learn about different styles of participatory community dancing as it is done throughout these regions. Students will learn about the contexts (celebrations, gatherings, weddings, etc.) in which dances are done and about how dance is used to establish social hierarchies, communicate cultural values, and mark dancers for cultural identity and ideology. \nThe exploration of dance as a form of individual and group expression will be fostered through movement, written assignments and discussions. Upon completing this course, students will acquire a deeper appreciation for the dance in traditional and modern folk cultures.",

During the first quarter of the semester, existing medical devices will be examined and analyzed. In the next half of the semester, students will build two to four devices in design modules. Students will first learn about the conceptual and practical aspects of a device and then implement that device. The modules will focus on technologies, such as microfluidics, electronics, flexible electronics, mechanical and micromechanical components, soft materials, sensors, optical elements, and software. For the last quarter of the course, students will compete in the design and testing of a medical device challenge.",

Aimed at engineering and science students, the objective of the course is to foster among them global intelligence (or global smarts), defined as an inclusive and cross-disciplinary working knowledge of how the globe operates today - including (1) how global infrastructures in communication, transportation and information technology have transformed how nations and corporations conduct business, (2) how nurturing sustainability ensures competitive advantage  while ignoring it imperils nations as well as the planet, and (3) how technological innovation is critical both in maintaining competitive advantage and in providing the essential sustainable solutions to many of our current global challenges. In a flat world, fostering global intelligence has become a vital component of a well-rounded engineering and science education.",

This course will introduce students to these new data and computational tools.  As a field, bioinformatics is built around a core of fundamental evolutionary biology concepts and these will serve as an organizing theme for the course.  Lectures provide 1) the conceptual and methodological basis of how large-scale biological data -- especially genomic and transcriptomic data -- are analyzed, 2) the basic biological principles that underlie bioinformatic analyses, in particular homology, duplication and loss of genes and genomic regions, types and rates of mutation in genomes, and the basic evolutionary forces that shape genomes 3) descriptions of contemporary problems in bioinformatics and computational and wet-laboratory approaches to addressing these issues, and 4) experience with current genomic and other large-scale data sets and databases as well as the computational methods for their analysis.",

In addition students will be provided with a basic working knowledge of the Matlab environment: They will learn how to create, edit, compile, and run programs in Matlab. Moreover, students will be provided with a basic working knowledge of Gnuplot: They will become familiar with 2D and 3D plotting techniques. Furthermore, students will be introduced to Numerical Recipes and the GNU Scientific Library.",

At its core are new molecular methods called metagenomics to sequence DNA directly from an environmental sample, thus capturing the whole microbial community and bypassing culture.  Modern (Next-Gen) sequencing technologies offer vast new datasets of short sequence reads representing these microbial communities, however many hurdles exist in interpreting data with high species complexity and given specialized software for microbial metagenomic analyses.  This course focuses on the science of metagenomics towards understanding (1) questions that metagenomics can address, (2) possible approaches for metagenomic sequencing and analysis, and (3) how genes, pathways, and environmental context are translated into ecosystem-level knowledge.  This course alternates between traditional lectures and hands-on experience with programming, bioinformatics tools, and metagenomic analysis.  The course concludes with several weeks of seminar-format discussions on current research in metagenomic data analysis and a final project of your choice analyzing real-world experimental data.",

Aimed at engineering and science students, the objective of the course is to foster among them global intelligence (or global smarts), defined as an inclusive and cross-disciplinary working knowledge of how the globe operates today - including (1) how global infrastructures in communication, transportation and information technology have transformed how nations and corporations conduct business, (2) how nurturing sustainability ensures competitive advantage  while ignoring it imperils nations as well as the planet, and (3) how technological innovation is critical both in maintaining competitive advantage and in providing the essential sustainable solutions to many of our current global challenges. In a flat world, fostering global intelligence has become a vital component of a well-rounded engineering and science education.",

This spatial scale is compatible with such advanced tasks as manipulation of subcellular structures, interfacing cellular functions with electronics, assembly of biomimetic materials and devices, or synthetic biology. Such technologies may help develop new medical diagnostic tools or treatment modalities, augment impaired functions of the body or replace those that were lost as a result of injuries or congenital disorder.  This course will provide an overview of fundamental concepts underlying these technological advances, such as quantum mechanics, chemical kinetics, and materials science. Subsequently, experimental tools appropriate for working on the nanoscale will be introduced. Finally, the class will review applications of nanotechnology with particular focus on applications addressing biological and medical needs.",
