    "# Introduction\n",
    "The ability to determine a student's progress towards degree completion is a fundamental capability used throughout higher education.\n",
    "Specifically, given a collection of degree requirements a student must satisfy in order to earn the credential associated with an academic program, we are interested in answering questions related to degree progress relative to a student record.  A student record is assumed to contain the set of courses a student has attempted to complete, along with the grades they have earned on these attempts.  We are interested in answering the following types of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Degree Completion Progress**. For a given degree program at a particular institution, which degree requirements are satisfied by a given student transcript?  Note: degree completion progress capabilities can be used to perform \"degree audits.\"\n",
    "- **Cohort Analytics**. This involve the aggregation of individual degree progress analyses for the purpose of answering cohort-based analytics questions. E.g., what is the average progress of a particular first-time full-time cohort, and the expected graduation rate of the cohort based upon this progress?\n",
    "- **Transfer Articulation**. Given a student transcript from institution $A$, and a transfer articulation plan that details how courses at institution $A$ transfer as course credits to institution $B$, determine the degree requirements satisfied by the student transcript at institution $B$?  This capability can be used to support what-if analyses over an entire system of schools. E.g., given a student record from institution $A$, and a collection of institutions $\\Omega = (B, C, D, \\ldots)$, along with the transfer articulation plans from $A$ to every institution in $\\Omega$, for each program at each institution in $\\Omega$, what degree requirements are satisfied by the student record through transfer articulation? Based on these results, a student may wish to know which of the degrees offered by the institutions in $\\Omega$ they are closest to earning.\n",
    "- **Reverse Transfer Articulation**. Given a student transcript that includes credits from institutions $A$ and $B$, and a a transfer articulation plan that details how courses at institution $B$ transfer as course credits to institution $A$, determine if the entire set of degree requirements for any program at institution $A$ can be satisfied by transferring some credits from institution $B$."

    "## Degree Requirements, Degree Plans, and Curricula\n",
    "In order to better understand this work, it is helpful to establish some terminology related to academic degree programs. Any degree program (aka, major or academic program) at a college has a set of *degree requirements* that must be satisfied by students in order for them to earn the degree associated with the program.  For instance, a program at the undergraduate level may require its students to satisfy a general education core, major requirements, elective requirements, minor requirements, etc. For instance, in order for a student to earn the BA in Biology degree, they must complete a set of courses that satisfy all of the degree requirements associated with BA in Biology pogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular collection of courses a student uses to satisfy a program's degree requirements is referred to as a *curriculum*. It is generally the case that many different curricula can satisfy a given set of degree requirements. For instance, students are given freedom in how to select the courses needed to satisfy technical electives, general electives, etc., and each choice produces a slightly different curriculum. The notion that a single set of degree requirements can be satisfied by numerous curricula is depicted in Figure 1. \n",
    "In summary, a curriculum specifies a set of courses, that if completed while earning sufficient grades, will lead to the conferral of a degree.\n",

    "<center>Figure 1. The relationships between degree requirements, curricula and degree plans.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the courses in a curriculum often have prerequisite arrangements between them which create constraints on the order in which courses may be taken. More broadly, a degree plan for completing a curriculum over a certain number of terms is often provided to students. That is, a *degree plan* includes a temporal component that stipulates how a curriculum should be organized on a term-by-term basis. Figure 1 depicts the fact that, depending upon how courses are arranged, many different degree plans can be constructed from a single curriculum.\n",

    "We now demonstrate, using the Theorem state below, that the expressive power of the requirement tree formulation is universal (functionally complete); that is, it can be used to represent any set of degree requirements expressible as Boolean functions. (Note: A functionally complete set of Boolean operators is capable of representing all Boolean functions $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}, n \\ge 1$.) This means that any set of degree requirements specified using propositional logic can be represented in a requirements tree, where satisfaction of the propositional logical formula in this case corresponds to satisfaction of the corresponding degree requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** Any set of degree requirements expressible as a Boolean formula over a collection of courses can be represented using the previously described formal model for degree requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** Consider a collection of courses, $c_1, \\ldots, c_n$, that may be used to satisfy a set of degree requirements. Create a collection of Boolean literals, $v_1, \\ldots, v_n$, where $v_i$ evaluates true if course $c_i$ was completed while earning the minimum grade necessary for it to count towards the satisfaction of a degree requirement. (If the same course appears in more than one degree requirement with different minimum required grades, simply treat this as two courses.) Using these literals, construct a disjunctive normal form (DNF) Boolean expression that evaluates true if and only if the set of earned course grades satisfy the degree requirements.  Because DNF expressions are functionally complete, we will demonstrate how to convert any DNF expression into an equivalent requirement tree. Consider a DNF expression consisting of a disjunction of $k$ conjunctive clauses, each containing a subset of the $n$ literals.  For each of the $k$ clauses create a separate course set, where each course set contains the courses corresponding to the literals in its corresponding clause, and set the minimum number of required credits in each course set to be the sum of the credits associated with the courses in the course set.  Note that a conjunctive clause will only evaluate true if all of the literals it contains evaluate true, and that the course set constructed from this clause will only be satisfied if all of the courses it contains are successfully completed.  Next, consider the disjunction $(p \\lor q)$ involving clauses $p$ and $q$, and assume the course set construction just described was used to construct course sets from clauses $p$ and $q$.  Construct three requirement sets using the course sets for $p$ and $q$, and organize them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"requirement_set_construct.pdf\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where requirement sets $a$ and $b$ are set to satisfy one of their two child requirements, and requirement set $c$ is set to satisfy both of its child requirements. In addition, set both of the $p$ course sets and both of the $q$ course sets to allow double counting.  To see why the requirement set construction above will only be satisfied when $(p \\lor q)$ evaluates true, notice that satisfying one of two child requirements in a requirement set is equivalent to an exclusive disjunction, and satisfying two of two child requirements in a requirement set is equivalent to a conjunction. Then, using the fact that  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "   (p \\lor q) = (p \\oplus q) \\oplus (p \\land q)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "the result follows.  Finally, use the same construction as above to create the necessary requirement sets associated with all of the remaining disjunctions in the original DNF expression.  QED\n",

    "We will use $\\langle B\\rangle$, where $B$ is a boolean formula, to specify an indicator variable.  Specifically, \n",

    "$$\n",
    "Using this notation, the second set of constraints associated with course set requirements is given by the following set of indicator constraints:\\footnote{For indicator constraint, $\\langle B\\rangle \\implies$ constraint $\\Gamma$, if $B$ is true, constraint $\\Gamma$ will be added to the ILP problem.} \n",
