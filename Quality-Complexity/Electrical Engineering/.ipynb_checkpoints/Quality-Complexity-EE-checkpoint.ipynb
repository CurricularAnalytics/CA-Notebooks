    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we compare the complexity of electrical engineering programs across the U.S. News & World report rankings, revealing a surprising finding, namely that higher ranked programs tend to have less complex curricula.  Because the curricular complexity metrics used here directly relate to a student's ability to complete that curriculum, this means that from a structural perspective (i.e., the manner in which curricula are structured), it is generally easier for students to complete the electrical engineering curricula at higher ranked schools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is based upon recently developed curricular complexity metrics (see <cite data-cite=\"he:18\">Heileman, et. al, (2018)</cite>).  Research in this area demonstrates that according to these complexity metrics, engineering programs tend to be among the most complex univeristy curricula. This is attributed to the large number of prerequisites that accompany many of the courses in engineering programs, as well as the long prerequisite chains that tend to exist in these curricula. This notebook makes use use of a Curricular Analytics toolbox that was built to compute these curricular complexity metrics <cite data-cite=\"he:18\">Heileman, et. al. (2019)</cite>).    \n",

    "The most well-known rankings in higher education are conducted by the U.S. News & World Report. In this study we used the rankings provided by the U.S. News & World Report 2018 Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs survey as a proxy for program quality~\\cite{BaBo:10,By:18}.  That is, for the purpose of this study, we assume that the \"best\" engineering programs are synonymous with the highest quality engineering programs.  We acknowledge the concerns that are routinely expressed concerning these rankings~\\cite{}.  However, it should be noted that this study uses aggregations of schools with tiers, and the statistics associated with the aggregations.  Thus, the specific rankings of the schools within the tiers are irrelevant, all that matters is the tier in which a school is placed. Upon inspection of the schools within each tier, we believe that knowledgable and impartial observes would agree that the three tiers constructed in this study are highly correlated with the program quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To appear on a U.S. News & World Report undergraduate engineering survey, a school must have at least one undergraduate engineering program that is accredited by ABET. Two surveys are conducted, one for schools whose highest engineering degree offered is a doctorate and another for schools whose highest engineering degree offered is a bachelor's or master's. For this study we consider the ranking provided by the former; that is, the ranking of doctoral institutions. This ranking is based solely on the peer assessment provided by deans and senior faculty members at doctoral institutions, and involves asking these survey participants to rate each program they are familiar with on a scale from 1~(marginal) to 5~(distinguished). Two peer assessment surveys are sent to each ABET-accredited engineering program at these schools, with a response rate of approximately 58%.  U.S. News & World Report uses the two most recent years' responses to calculate weighted average scores of programs, which determines the ranking. The U.S. News & World Report 2018 Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs rankings for doctoral institutions lists 205 schools, with a formal ranking designation given to the programs in the 1-177 range. Programs ranked lower than 177 are listed alphabetically and lumped into a ranking category. "

    "## Experimental Design\n",
    "The question of interest in this study is whether or not curricular complexity is related to program quality. In order to answer this question, we constructed an analysis of variance~(ANOVA) experiment that involved partitioning the schools in the U.S. News & World Report 2018 Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs rankings according to their decile within the ranking. From these three groups were created as follows. A *top tier* of schools defined as those in the first decile of the ranking.  A *mid tier*, defined as the set of schools in the fifth and sixth deciles of the ranking that are equidistant from first to last ranked schools. Due to the large number of ties that occur in the middle of the ranking, this resulted in selecting only those schools tied for 82-nd and 99-nth in the ranking, for a total of 26 schools. A *bottom tier* of schools comprised of the schools ranked below 177, which spans approximately three deciles. The null hypothesis is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"There is no difference between the mean values of the curricular complexities of those schools belonging \n",
    "     to the top, mid and bottom tiers.\" \n",

    "The alternative hypothesis is then: \n",
    "\n",
    "    \"At least one of the curricular complexity mean values of a school tier differs significantly from the \n",
    "     means of the other two tiers.\"\n",
    "     \n",
    "The ANOVA analysis involves random sampling of schools within each of the three tiers. In order to ensure the analysis is able to distinguish between actual curricular complexity differences among the tiers, and random variation, sufficient sample sizes must be determined. Under the assumption that the curricular complexity distributions within the tiers are approximately normal, with variance $\\sigma^2$, the number of samples that should be selected from each tier is given by\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " n = \\left({\\sigma Z \\over E}\\right)^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $Z$ is the confidence interval expressed using deviation within the standard normal distribution, and $E$ is the margin of error. To obtain an estimate of $\\sigma$, pilot samples from each of the three tiers were taken, yielding the estimate $\\hat{\\sigma} = 90$. For a 95\\% confidence interval, which corresponds to $Z = 1.96$, the margin of error will be 40 curricular complexity points, i.e., 20 points on either side of the mean for a tier. Using these values in the equation provided above leads to sample sizes of $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = 20$, where $n_1, n_2$ and $n_3$ are the sample sizes for the top, medium and bottom tiers, respectively. Thus, by sampling at least 20 schools from each tier, we can have 95\\% confidence that the error in this analysis will be by no more than 40 curricular complexity points.\n",
