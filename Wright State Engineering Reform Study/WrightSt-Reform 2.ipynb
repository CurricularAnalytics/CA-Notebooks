We then consider how the curricular reforms implemented by the College of Engineering at Wright St. University facilitate student progression.  This analysis is specific to the Electrical Engineering (EE) programs; however, it is broadly applicable to engineering undergraduate programs at any institution. \n",

    "In the figure above, if you hover over *EE 211 - Circuits I* in the third term, you will see that this course is on a path of length 8 (this determines the delay factor metric shown in the figure), there are eight course that serve as pre- or co-requisites courses that must be completed before a student may take Circuit Analysis I, and Circuit Analysis I \"blocks\" twelve other courses in the curriculum (i.e., these courses cannot be attempted until Circuit Analysis I has been successfully completed).  Thus, Circuit Analysis I is a very important course in this curriculum.  Another way to say this is that Circuit Analysis I is central to the curriculum.  Indeed, it is course with the highest centrality factor in the curriculum.  The centrality factor is measure of how many course prerequisite pathways include a given course.

Even though these programs are identically accredited with identical program learning outcomes, it is readily apparent that their structures are quite dissimilar.

    "### Wright State University Reform\n",

The key factor enabling this innovation is that fact that a typical Circuits I course only requires the ability to solve first order differential equations, and that it's possible to teach basic concepts regarding first order differential equations, as well as solution techniques, to students prior to taking Calculus I.  At Wright State University, this knowledge is imparted in the Engineering 101 class in the very first semester.  Here's what the reformed curriculum looks like:"
